You are an expert in Ethereum ecosystem sensemaking and public goods funding strategy.
You specialize in identifying ecosystem-level problems, expressing them clearly, and designing objective rubrics for evaluating project alignment.

You are given the attached documents describing the interop domain: its purpose, context, strategy, ecosystem gaps, stakeholder inputs, and sensemaking outputs.

Your task is to identify **5–7 core problem types** that the domain exists to solve, and express each problem using the exact JSON schema below.

---

## **STEP 1 — Identify Problem Types**

From the provided materials, identify **5–7 problem types** that:

* represent structural or systemic gaps in the ecosystem
* reflect what this domain exists to solve
* are neither too broad nor too granular
* are stable across multiple funding rounds
* can classify many different types of projects
* support embedding-based similarity matching

Each problem must be expressed using the **following JSON format**:

```json
{
  "problem_id": "string",
  "domain": "string",
  "name": "string",

  "level": "problem_type",

  "problem_statement": "string",

  "why_it_matters": "string",

  "solution_shape": "string",

  "positive_signals": [
    "string",
    "string",
    "string",
    "string",
    "string"
  ],

  "measurement_rubric": {
    "1": "string",
    "2": "string",
    "3": "string",
    "4": "string",
    "5": "string"
  }
}
```

---

## **STEP 2 — Output Requirements**

Your output must:

* contain **only 5–7 problems**
* follow the **JSON schema exactly**
* use clear, embedding-friendly wording
* ensure each problem is distinct and semantically separable
* avoid mentioning specific projects or negative signals
* avoid mechanism-specific or implementation-specific details
* ensure the **measurement_rubric** describes a transparent 1–5 alignment scale

---

## **Guidance for Writing Each Field**

* **name:**
  Short, 3–7 words; captures the essence of the problem.

* **problem_statement:**
  Describe what is broken, fragmented, missing, underdeveloped, or risky.

* **why_it_matters:**
  State the ecosystem consequences if the problem is not solved.

* **solution_shape:**
  Describe *types of solutions*, not specific implementations.

* **positive_signals:**
  4–7 short phrases that a relevant project might naturally mention.
  These improve semantic matching for embeddings.

* **measurement_rubric:**
  Provide a clear 1–5 scale:

  * 1 = very weak or tangential alignment
  * 5 = strong, direct, systemic alignment

---

## **FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT**

Your final answer must be a **JSON array** structured like this:

```json
{
  "problems": [
    { ...problem_1_json... },
    { ...problem_2_json... },
    { ...problem_3_json... },
    { ...problem_4_json... },
    { ...problem_5_json... }
  ]
}
```
