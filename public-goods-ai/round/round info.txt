:dr-casper-1: **Call for Proposals: AI for Public Goods Fast Grants**
=====================================================================

Artificial intelligence offers unprecedented opportunities to transform how we fund and support public goods. From optimizing grant allocation to predicting project impact, AI methodologies can make funding systems more effective, transparent, and equitable. Yet developing and deploying AI solutions for public goods presents unique challenges that require innovative thinking and diverse perspectives.

The **AI for Public Goods Fast Grants program** provides up to **$10,000** per proposal to accelerate AI research and development that improves public goods funding decision-making. We're seeking projects that address real-world challenges in funding allocation, impact assessment, governance, and community coordination. Whether you're exploring machine learning for grant matching, natural language processing for proposal evaluation, or AI-driven governance tools, we want to hear from you.

This program is designed as a **fast grants initiative**: streamlined applications (max 4-page proposals & max 1000 words), rapid review (within 4 weeks), and focused project timelines (1-6 months). We particularly welcome researchers from non-traditional backgrounds, practitioners with on-the-ground experience, and teams from the Global South who bring diverse perspectives to AI development.

Funded projects will contribute to an emerging field while producing open-source research, datasets, and insights that benefit the broader public goods funding community. All research outputs will be eligible for publication in the Recerts Journal, helping to establish rigorous standards for this growing area of work.

**Ready to help shape the future of public goods funding? Read on for selection criteria and application instructions.**

:dr-casper-3: Selection Criteria
================================

Proposals will be reviewed through a single-blind process by independent reviewers with expertise in AI, machine learning, and/or public goods funding.

Projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:

**Public goods funding relevance:** Projects should demonstrate a clear link to improving decision-making in public goods funding systems. This includes grant allocation, impact assessment, governance mechanisms, community coordination, or related challenges. The relationship to public goods funding should be explicit and well-articulated.

**AI/ML relevance:** Projects should employ or address AI or ML in a way that is well-motivated and well-scoped for the problem setting. This includes both projects where AI or ML are a central component, as well as those where AI or ML are one among many components. Projects proposing the implementation of AI/ML techniques will not be penalized if other techniques or approaches are found to be better-suited as the project progresses; negative results are welcome if well-tested.

**Pathway to impact:** Proposals should address how their work, if successful, can be deployed or implemented in practice to improve public goods funding systems. This can be addressed in the form of deployments planned as part of the project itself, or via a concrete plan for disseminating the work among relevant organizations, funding platforms, or communities.

**Ethics:** Proposals should explicitly discuss ethical considerations and implications of their work. This includes discussion of relevant stakeholders and equity considerations of the problems addressed, as well as the scope and potential negative social impacts of the proposed solution, including how these risks will be avoided or mitigated in the project's execution. Considerations may include algorithmic bias, fairness in allocation, transparency, privacy, and power dynamics in funding decisions.

**Feasibility:** The scope of the proposed project should be realistic with respect to the associated timeline (3-6 months) and budget (up to $10,000).

**Expertise of team:** The proposed team should have demonstrated expertise in areas of relevance to the development and execution of their project, notably in public goods funding mechanisms and/or AI/ML. Interdisciplinarity and diversity within the proposed team will be viewed favorably. Teams that bring together researchers and practitioners will be viewed favorably.

In addition, the following aspects will be considered favorably during the review process:

**Implementation partners:** Project teams including relevant organizations (funding platforms, grant-making organizations, DAOs, public goods projects, etc.) through whom the proposed work could be impactfully deployed will be viewed favorably.

**Traditionally under-funded areas of work:** Projects that are impactful but may not be traditionally covered through other funding streams will be given priority as part of this call. Examples include projects that may not fit neatly into one discipline or area of study, or projects serving communities with limited access to capital or technical resources.

**Equity:** Projects that explicitly incorporate equity-related considerations --- e.g., through the choice of problem addressed, stakeholders that are partnered with, or methods that promote fairness in allocation --- will be viewed favorably.

**Global South and underrepresented researchers:** Projects led by researchers from the Global South, global majority countries, or traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in AI research will be viewed favorably.

Across the full cohort of grantees, we will additionally seek to allocate grants to represent multiple approaches to AI for public goods, diverse geographic regions, and a mix of theoretical and applied projects.
