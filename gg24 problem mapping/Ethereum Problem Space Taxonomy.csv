Ethereum Level 2 Problem,Ethereum Level 2 Problem Description,Ethereum Level 1 Problem,Ethereum Level 1 Problem Description
Layer-1 Throughput Limits,"Ethereum L1 currently handles ~10-25 TPS, causing high fees and poor UX during congestion.Increasing block capacity (e.g. danksharding data blobs) is needed without sacrificing decentralization.",Scalability & Throughput,"Ethereum’s foremost challenge is scaling network throughput to meet global demand. The Surge roadmap focuses on scaling via sharding and rollups to reach ~100,000 transactions per second."
Data Availability Constraints,"Through sharding and data availability sampling, Ethereum must provide more data capacity for rollups. Insufficient data availability keeps L2 transaction costs high.",Scalability & Throughput,"Ethereum’s foremost challenge is scaling network throughput to meet global demand. The Surge roadmap focuses on scaling via sharding and rollups to reach ~100,000 transactions per second."
Layer-2 Rollup Scalability,"Optimistic and ZK-rollups require technical improvements (e.g. decentralized sequencers, faster proving, enshrined rollups) to securely scale out and handle most activity off L1.",Scalability & Throughput,"Ethereum’s foremost challenge is scaling network throughput to meet global demand. The Surge roadmap focuses on scaling via sharding and rollups to reach ~100,000 transactions per second."

The Surge roadmap focuses on scaling via sharding and rollups to reach ~100,000 transactions per second."
MEV Extraction & Fair Ordering,"MEV creates a centralizing force in block production, as sophisticated searchers and builders extract profit by reordering transactions. Mitigating MEV (through proposer/builder separation improvements, PBS auctions, or MEV burn) is crucial to prevent censorship and unfair ordering.","Decentralization, MEV & Censorship Resistance","Unchecked MEV and centralization can undermine Ethereum’s credibility and security. While MEV research (e.g. PBS, CRList) is active, solutions are nascent and ecosystem urgency is growing as MEV revenue and staking centralization climb."
Censorship Resistance,"With proposer/builder separation, there’s risk of block builders or relays censoring transactions. Protocol changes (e.g. encrypted mempools or committed ordering) are needed to ensure reliable neutral inclusion of all transactions.","Decentralization, MEV & Censorship Resistance","Unchecked MEV and centralization can undermine Ethereum’s credibility and security. While MEV research (e.g. PBS, CRList) is active, solutions are nascent and ecosystem urgency is growing as MEV revenue and staking centralization climb."
Validator Decentralization,"Ethereum staking and node operation must remain distributed. Today, liquid staking pools and large node operators pose centralization concerns. Research into incentive tweaks or caps for staking dominance, and promotion of solo staking or diverse validator sets, addresses systemic risk.","Decentralization, MEV & Censorship Resistance","Unchecked MEV and centralization can undermine Ethereum’s credibility and security. While MEV research (e.g. PBS, CRList) is active, solutions are nascent and ecosystem urgency is growing as MEV revenue and staking centralization climb."

While MEV research (e.g. PBS, CRList) is active, solutions are nascent and ecosystem urgency is growing as MEV revenue and staking centralization climb."
State Bloat,"Ethereum’s state (accounts, contracts, storage) grows continuously, increasing storage requirements (full nodes need ~2 TB today) and slowing sync times. Verkle trees and stateless clients are proposed to compress state and allow nodes to verify with small proofs instead of holding all data",State Growth & Storage Efficiency,This area is crucial for decentralization long-term (more lightweight nodes = more participants) and has a significant effect on scalability (smaller state and faster proofs can eventually allow bigger blocks or more shards).
Historical Data Accumulation,"Nodes must store all historical blocks unless pruned. The Purge introduces history expiry (EIP-4444) to drop ancient history and eliminate technical debt, reducing disk overhead for node runners. Dedicated archive nodes can serve old data on demand, while regular nodes stay lean.",State Growth & Storage Efficiency,This area is crucial for decentralization long-term (more lightweight nodes = more participants) and has a significant effect on scalability (smaller state and faster proofs can eventually allow bigger blocks or more shards).
Sync and Proof Efficiency,New nodes currently take days to sync. Improving sync protocols and using SNARKs/STARKs to verify blocks quickly will lower the barrier to participation.

Resource Costs for Validators,"High resource requirements (CPU, bandwidth) for validators and nodes can limit decentralization. Research into optimizing witness sizes, single-slot finality (which may require capping validators), and more efficient gossip protocols all help keep participation costs low",State Growth & Storage Efficiency,This area is crucial for decentralization long-term (more lightweight nodes = more participants) and has a significant effect on scalability (smaller state and faster proofs can eventually allow bigger blocks or more shards).
Smart Contract Vulnerabilities,"Bugs in DeFi protocols and NFTs have led to frequent hacks. Many projects prioritized growth over security best practices, resulting in reentrancy, oracle manipulation, and logic flaws. There is a need for better auditing, formal verification tools, and secure-by-design frameworks to reduce contract bugs.",Security & Resilience,"While top projects and the Ethereum Foundation invest in security, many vulnerabilities persist, and underfundedness is evident in areas like open-source auditing tools and formal verification (which receive less attention than flashy dApps). "
Cross-Chain Bridge Exploits,"Bridges are high-value targets – failures in validation or multisig security have caused some of the largest losses in Ethereum’s history.

"
Consensus/Client Security,"Ethereum must remain robust against attacks on its consensus.

"
Transaction Privacy,"Currently, any on-chain activity is visible to all, which is unsuitable for sensitive applications. Zero-knowledge proofs and zkSNARK-based constructions can enable private transactions or shielded token transfers, but integrating these at scale (e.g. layer-2 privacy chains or L1 shielded pools) is an open problem.",Privacy & Identity,"Given that the Ethereum Foundation and community have only a few dedicated teams (e.g. PSE) and grants focusing on privacy, this area is relatively under-resourced. It deserves prioritization to ensure Ethereum doesn’t lose users to more privacy-centric chains, and to uphold values like civil liberties in the Web3 era."
On-Chain Identity & Data,"Users lack native ways to prove identity or credentials without revealing private data. Solutions like decentralized identity (DID) standards, attestations, or Soulbound Tokens are being explored, but ensuring they preserve privacy (selective disclosure, zk-credentials) is key for broad adoption in areas like credit, reputation, or government services.",Privacy & Identity,"Given that the Ethereum Foundation and community have only a few dedicated teams (e.g. PSE) and grants focusing on privacy, this area is relatively under-resourced. It deserves prioritization to ensure Ethereum doesn’t lose users to more privacy-centric chains, and to uphold values like civil liberties in the Web3 era."

Mechanisms such as viewing keys or zero-knowledge regulatory proofs need development.",Privacy & Identity,"Given that the Ethereum Foundation and community have only a few dedicated teams (e.g. PSE) and grants focusing on privacy, this area is relatively under-resourced. It deserves prioritization to ensure Ethereum doesn’t lose users to more privacy-centric chains, and to uphold values like civil liberties in the Web3 era."

Sustainable Funding Mechanisms,"How to continuously deploy funds to essential projects (clients, libraries, research) without relying on one-off grants or altruism. Challenges include designing funding streams (treasury inflows, protocol revenue allocation) and deciding when and how funds should flow for maximum impact.",Ecosystem Funding & Coordination,"Sustaining Ethereum’s long-term progress requires robust public goods funding (PGF) and governance mechanisms. The past few years have seen multiple experiments (Gitcoin QF rounds, DAO grants, Protocol Guild, Optimism RetroPGF, etc.), yet several core problems remain unsolved in funding Ethereum’s public goods."
Allocation Effectiveness,"Determining who decides funding priorities and how to aggregate preferences is an open question. Quadratic funding, token-weight votes, and committee review each have trade-offs in fairness and efficiency.
