🌍 Regen Network: Building the Semantic Backbone for Open Intents
Executive Summary / Vision
Ethereum gave the world programmable money. Now, we’re helping it get programmable meaning.

Regen Network is building the semantic bridge between Ethereum’s Open Intents and real-world ecological action — a shared grammar for verifiable regeneration.

With this infrastructure, any DAO or wallet can express an intent (“fund reforestation,” “offset carbon,” “reward biodiversity”), and watch it fulfill through verified claims, attestations, and Hypercerts — all composable on Ethereum.

Only on Ethereum can coordination, capital, and legitimacy converge at this scale — and Regen is bringing the language of living systems to that convergence.

Regen Network is evolving from a sovereign regenerative ledger into a bundle of open coordination utilities for the Ethereum ecosystem—technical and semantic infrastructure dedicated to ecological and social regeneration.

For the last five years, Regen has pioneered verifiable ecological crediting systems in the Cosmos ecosystem, setting global precedents for how environmental data can be transparently anchored, verified, and tokenized. Through the Ecocredit Module, Data Module, and open standards like Regen Data Schemas, Regen created a foundation for ecological finance that others now build upon.

But the future of coordination—and of regeneration—belongs to the commons. Ethereum is becoming the universal substrate for interoperable public goods. To truly scale regeneration, Regen must come home to Ethereum: integrating regen semantics, verification logic, and data standards into Ethereum’s open coordination stack.

Our goal is simple but profound:

Any DAO, organization, or wallet should be able to fund, verify, and reward real-world regeneration through Open Intents on Ethereum or any L2.

This proposal funds Phase 1 of that transition—a critical leap that connects Regen’s Claims Engine and Data Standards with Hypercerts v0.2 and the Open Intents Framework (OIF). Together, these systems will establish the first semantic backbone for on-chain ecological and social claims, allowing any Ethereum application to issue, fulfill, or verify regenerative actions.

Problem Statement & Opportunity
Ethereum’s coordination stack is powerful yet incomplete. It enables collective intent—through DAOs, retroactive funding, attestations, and hypercerts—but lacks the semantic and verifiable layer required to connect those on-chain intentions with complex real-world outcomes.

Today’s limitation: Ethereum protocols can say what they want to fund (“plant trees,” “support biodiversity”), but not what counts as proof that those outcomes occurred.
Missing piece: a common schema and verification pipeline linking on-chain coordination primitives (intents, attestations, hypercerts) with credible off-chain data and claims.
Result: projects reinvent data structures and verification each time, fragmenting legitimacy and interoperability.
Regen has already solved this problem within its own ledger ecosystem. Its data modules, content-hash anchoring, and LinkML/YAML schemas express verifiable claims about ecological state changes. Now, we propose to translate that semantic foundation into Ethereum-native form—unlocking verifiable, composable regeneration across the open coordination economy.

By aligning with the Open Intents framework, which generalizes coordination into programmable intents, and Hypercerts, which define impact metadata, Regen brings the missing semantic layer: meaning, provenance, and verifiable trust.

Technical Vision & Architecture
Overview

Phase 1 creates the Claims ↔ Intents Bridge—a minimal, working interoperability layer connecting Regen’s semantic verification tools with Ethereum’s coordination protocols.

1 · Schema & Specification Layer

Treat Regen’s LinkML/YAML schemas as canonical source for ecological claims.
Extend minimally for intents–claims alignment.
Auto-generate:
JSON Schema → lightweight validation & EAS compatibility.
JSON-LD context/frame → semantic provenance & graph integrity.
Publish as “Claims Schema for Intents v0.1” under an open-standard license.
2 · API & Service Layer

Define OpenRPC interface for Claims Engine operations (create, anchor, attest, resolve).
Provide example JSON payloads and CLI/API validator.
Document end-to-end flow from intent submission to verified claim.
3 · Interoperability Bridges

OIF Resolver/Verifier: consumes ecological intents, verifies data, emits Regen claims.
Hypercerts Bridge: maps verified claims → Hypercert metadata; allows mint/update.
EAS Attestations: register compact claim hash + IRI on-chain.
Optional Subgraph Indexer: joins Hypercert tokens, EAS UIDs, and off-chain claim CIDs.
4 · Proof-of-Concept Prototype

Demonstrate the full round trip:

Submit an Open Intent (JSON).
Resolver generates a Regen Claim (JSON-LD).
Anchor hash + IRI via Ethereum Attestation Service.
Optionally mint a Hypercert referencing the same CID.
Deliverable: a simple CLI or web demo + scripts showing this flow end-to-end.

5 · Open Source & Community Standards

Publish all specs & OpenRPC definitions in Regen’s GitHub.
Develop publicly through an RFC process with OIF community.
Coordinate with Hypercerts Foundation for v0.2 metadata alignment.
Regen acts as peer verifier and reference implementation, not central authority.
Outcome

A verifiable, semantically grounded interoperability stack:

Regen LinkML → JSON Schema/JSON-LD → EAS Attestations + Hypercert Metadata → OIF Intents resolved through Regen Claims Engine.

Ethereum remains the settlement layer; Regen provides the semantic trust fabric.

Next Steps & Roadmap
Phase 1 — Semantic Specification & Prototype (Funded Here)

Publish Claims Schema for Intents v0.1
Define OpenRPC API & service reference.
Build minimal end-to-end prototype (intent → claim → attestation → hypercert).
Engage OIF community via RFC review.
Document findings & open repository.
Phase 2 — Operational Integration

Extend prototype to full on-chain execution: intents that automatically purchase & retire ecocredits.
Example flow: “Offset X tons of carbon” → verifies supply → executes purchase → retires credit → issues Hypercert.
Deploy on L2 testnets; invite early integrators (e.g., Giveth, Gitcoin, ReFi DAO).
Phase 3 — Generalized Claims-Intent Grammar

Expand schema beyond ecological credits to social, financial, or civic claims.
Release SDK & indexing tools for builders.
Formalize governance and community standardization process.
Ethereum Alignment & Ecosystem Integration
Regen’s migration from Cosmos app-chain to Ethereum utilities is a natural evolution toward interdependence over sovereignty. Ethereum’s ecosystem offers scale, liquidity, and a thriving culture of public-goods innovation.

Why Ethereum

Composability: OIF, EAS, and Hypercerts provide interoperable primitives Regen can extend.

Infrastructure Maturity: secure settlement, proven developer adoption.
How Regen Contributes

Semantic Trust Layer: expresses what a claim means and how it’s verified.
Verification Commons: open schemas anyone can reuse.
Cross-Chain Credibility: bridge between ecological data anchored on Regen and Ethereum’s coordination economy.
New Composables: standardized intents for ecological action, usable across DAOs and protocols.
Partner Ecosystem

Initial alignment points include:

Open Intents Framework – routing layer for programmable coordination.
Hypercerts Foundation – impact metadata + attribution model.
Ethereum Attestation Service – on-chain verification layer.
Giveth / Gitcoin / ReFi DAO – early adopter DAOs.
BlockScience / Regen Commons – research partners on legitimacy & systems design.
Together these collaborations weave the Regenerative Coordination Stack—Ethereum’s first fully semantic infrastructure for verifiable impact.

Open Source, Standards & Community Strategy
Regen will develop all code, schemas, and documentation publicly under permissive licenses. The repository will host:

schemas/ — LinkML sources and generated JSON/JSON-LD exports.
api/ — OpenRPC definitions, payload examples, and validator CLI.
specs/ — Claims Schema for Intents v0.1 + RFC discussion threads.
We will launch an open RFC process inviting feedback from the OIF and Hypercerts communities, ensuring alignment before standardization. Regen’s track record—stewarding open modules like x/group and many more in Cosmos—proves our commitment to community-governed standards.

"""Alignment with Domain Goals
Interoperability & Standards:
Our core deliverable is the “Claims Schema for Intents”, an open interoperability standard connecting Regen’s ecological data schemas with Ethereum’s Open Intents Framework and Hypercerts v0.2. This standard enables seamless composability between on-chain intents, attestations, and verified real-world impact data.
Open Infrastructure:
We are building an open-source API and service layer (OpenRPC) for the Regen Claims Engine, along with validation tools, JSON-LD contexts, and example payloads. These components provide foundational infrastructure for the OIF ecosystem—usable by any DAO, developer, or protocol to anchor, verify, and resolve ecological or social claims.
Open Data & Transparency:
Regen’s LinkML/YAML schemas are publicly maintained and automatically generate open JSON Schema and JSON-LD outputs. All data standards, interfaces, and proofs will be published to GitHub and IPFS, with accompanying documentation and usage examples to ensure public accessibility and auditability.
Adoption of the OIF:
The project directly extends and operationalizes the Open Intents Framework, demonstrating a live use-case where an intent (e.g., “offset 10 tons of carbon”) resolves to a verified, attestable on-chain claim. This pilot implementation advances the real-world adoption of OIF principles through ecological impact use cases.
Analytics Potential:
Our modular architecture (EAS attestations + subgraph indexing) lays the foundation for open analytics dashboards that track adoption, performance, and interoperability metrics for intents, claims, and Hypercert issuance across chains.
Research & Best Practices:
Regen contributes five years of experience in verifiable ecological data models within Cosmos, now translated into Ethereum form. Phase 1 includes research on schema alignment, OIF integration, and framework optimization to inform community standards."""
