The growth of every L1 and L2 is bottlenecked by a chaotic, fragmented, and inefficient process for developing new ideas.



The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process is the industry's gold standard, yet it remains a major struggle even for the Ethereum Foundation, while emerging ecosystems like Polygon, Optimism, Sui, and others are forced to reinvent the wheel, slowing innovation to a crawl, while others, such as Arbitrum, and protocols as Lido use DAO voting where specific standards such as AIPs and LIPs do not exist in commonly readable format at all .



DIP.box is the solution. We are building the critical public good infrastructure that web3 is missing: a universal, open-source platform to manage the entire lifecycle of decentralized intellectual property.



A donation to DIP.box is a donation to the entire web3 ecosystem. You are funding a foundational tool that will accelerate innovation, streamline collaboration, and onboard the next wave of builders and researchers by solving the real, painful problem of intellectual property (IP) management.



Help us build the schelling point for decentralized innovation.



The Problem: Innovation is Trapped in Chaos

Decentralized ecosystems thrive on community-driven improvements, but the very process is broken:

Fragmentation is the Enemy: Critical discussions are scattered across GitHub, multiple forums (EthResearch, EthMagicians), and Discord servers. There is no single source of truth, making it impossible to track the history, rationale, and status of an idea.
High Barrier to Entry: To contribute a formal proposal, one must be an expert in using GitHub, forks, and pull requests. This technical barrier excludes brilliant non-developer contributors like academics, researchers, and product managers. 1
Process Bottlenecks: Analysis shows that a huge number of proposals get stuck in "review" or "last call" stages, with the average proposal taking over 160 days to finalize. This is lost time, lost opportunity, and a direct threat to ecosystem competitiveness.
Reinventing the Wheel: Every new L1 and L2 struggles to implement a governance and improvement framework, repeating the same mistakes and failing to achieve the collaborative success of the EIP model.
Risk of ecosystem drainage: Lack of robust IP protection and planning is a risk for OSS ecosystems, where big institutional copycats can just use classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" to capture market back. (read this article for more details)
This chaos slows development, deters new contributors, and puts open-source ecosystems at a strategic disadvantage against their centralized competitors.







This is how EIP editor experience looks like today. Do protocol researchers really must know how to fork and use github?



Our Solution: DIP.box - The Platform for IP as a Real-World Asset (RWA)



We treat Improvement Proposals as what they are: high-value, decentralized Intellectual Property assets. And like any asset, they require professional tooling for their entire lifecycle.

DIP.box is a fully open-source (GPLv2), multi-tenant workspace designed to onboard any ecosystem, providing a unified and streamlined environment for innovation.










Key Features:

Multi-Tenant Architecture: DIP.box is not just for Ethereum. It's designed from the ground up to support any ecosystem (polygon.dip.box, ethereum.dip.box, starkware.dip.box, etc.), allowing them to manage their own sovereign innovation process on a shared, open-source stack.
A Universal Proposal State Machine: We provide a clear, configurable, and transparent lifecycle for every proposal. No more ambiguity about what stage a proposal is in or what the next steps are. This brings predictability and professionalism to decentralized R&D.
Simplified Editing Workspace: Our platform abstracts away the complexity of GitHub. A clean, web-based interface allows anyone to create, edit, and collaborate on proposals, automatically handling the backend version control.
Academia & Research Onboarding: A dedicated Request-for-Proposal (RFP) and knowledge hub will connect ecosystem needs directly with university students and academic researchers, creating a transparent public procurement process for cutting-edge research.

A generic data ingestion module to sync with any Git-based proposal repository.
A public, deployed version of the platform with read-only capabilities for several ecosystems.
Milestone 2: The Engine Room - Universal State Machine & Editing Workspace

Goal: Implement the core logic for managing the proposal lifecycle and provide a user-friendly editing experience that removes the need for Git expertise. This gives every builder a simple, powerful toolkit to turn ideas into reality.
Deliverables:
A configurable state machine module where each ecosystem can define its unique proposal lifecycle.
A web-based Markdown editor for creating and modifying proposals.
An "Author's Cabinet" for managing drafts and private collaborations. 8888
Integration that automates the creation of pull requests on behalf of the user.
Milestone 3: The Community Hub - Collaboration & RFP Module

Goal: Transform the platform from an editor into a vibrant collaborative hub and a bridge to researchers. This connects the brightest minds with the biggest challenges in web3.
Deliverables:
Discussion and commenting threads attached to each proposal.
A community feedback system to gauge sentiment and help prioritize maintainer reviews.
A dedicated "Request for Proposal" (RFP) module for ecosystems to post challenges and bounties.
A searchable "Knowledge Hub" for researchers to discover opportunities across web3.

Please example how your project meets the round-specific eligibility criteria.

"""DIP.box aligns strongly with the GG24: Interop Standards, Infra & Analytics round, primarily by fostering Ethereum Interoperability Standards and building crucial Interop Infrastructure for decentralized IP management.
Here's how DIP.box meets the round-specific eligibility criteria:
Advance Open Data Initiatives:
While not an analytics platform itself, DIP.box directly contributes to open data by structuring, standardizing, and centralizing the fragmented data around improvement proposals (EIPs, PIPs, etc.) across different ecosystems.
By providing a universal """"single source of truth"""" for proposal lifecycles and discussions, it makes the evolution of core standards more transparent and accessible. This organized data can then be readily consumed by analytics platforms to track the progress and impact of interoperability-focused proposals.
Build Interop Infrastructure:
DIP.box is fundamentally interoperability infrastructure. It's a multi-tenant platform designed to manage improvement proposals for any L1, L2, or application. This means:
It enables seamless coordination across L1s, L2s, and applications by providing a shared, standardized framework for defining and evolving their own interoperability standards.
It acts as a foundational tool for creating and formalizing the APIs, SDKs, and protocols that facilitate cross-chain communication and data exchange. For example, a new cross-chain messaging standard would go through a proposal process, and DIP.box would streamline that.
By facilitating consistent proposal processes, DIP.box reduces fragmentation at the conceptual and standardization layer, which is a prerequisite for robust technical interoperability.

Enable Evidence-Based Adoption of OIF (Indirectly but Fundamentally):

While DIP.box isn't directly building for the Open Intents Framework (OIF), it builds the foundational infrastructure for any new standard's adoption.

If OIF proposals or extensions were to go through a formal improvement proposal process, DIP.box would provide the ideal platform to manage their lifecycle, gather community feedback, and drive consensus. This would make the development and adoption of OIF more efficient and transparent, thereby indirectly supporting its evidence-based adoption.

Develop and Promote Ethereum Interoperability Standards:

This is a core fit. DIP.box is the tooling for defining, refining, and promoting the standards themselves. Whether it's a new ERC for token bridging, a cross-chain communication protocol proposal, or a general interoperability specification, DIP.box streamlines the collaborative process that leads to such standards.

By making the process of proposing and iterating on standards more efficient and accessible, DIP.box directly accelerates the development and adoption of interoperability standards within the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond.

Research Ethereum interoperability, user behavior, and framework optimization:

Our RFP (Request for Proposal) module is designed to connect ecosystems with academic researchers. This directly facilitates research into Ethereum interoperability challenges, user behavior concerning cross-chain interactions, and optimization of frameworks like OIF by providing a formal channel for research proposals and bounties.

In summary: DIP.box acts as a meta-layer for standardization and infrastructure development. By providing a universal, efficient, and transparent platform for managing all types of improvement proposals, it indirectly and fundamentally strengthens Ethereum's multi-chain future by ensuring that the underlying interoperability standards and infrastructure are built more effectively, inclusively, and rapidly."""
