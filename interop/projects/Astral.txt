Location-Based Services for Ethereum
The missing location layer for Web3 — making “where” a first-class primitive in decentralized systems.



Astral provides open infrastructure that lets dApps represent and reason about where things happen, unlocking a new class of location-aware applications on Ethereum.



Why It Matters
Location shapes many of the world’s most engaging digital experiences—mobility, gaming, social coordination, and discovery—but remains inaccessible to Web3.



Today, apps rely on inconsistent or easily spoofed signals, with no shared standard for expressing where something happened.



Astral changes that.



We’re developing a framework for location proofs—verifiable attestations that confirm location or region membership—and a network of interoperable location services that make it simple for developers to build spatially aware applications.



What’s Live
Astral SDK: Developer tools for creating verifiable location data attestations — onchain and offchain.
Astral API: A geospatial indexer for reading and validating signed spatial data.


What's Next
Location Proof Plugins Library: Extensible library for collecting location evidence for believable location claims.
Astral Location Services: A geofencing and verification layer for dApps, supported by GG24 funding.


What You Can Build
Social and cultural apps that activate based on verified presence
Games and quests that reward real-world exploration
Coordination and field tools for logistics, research, or response
Agents and AI systems that adapt to real-world context
Community or DAO applications that respond to place-based participation




Why Now
Ethereum’s stack — L2s, AVSs, zk systems — is mature enough to support verifiable real-world interaction.
The network’s multi-chain architecture calls for shared context standards like Astral’s.
Users and developers need interoperable ways to anchor digital activity in geography, without sacrificing control.
Astral Location Services provide a common foundation for location-aware logic across chains and ecosystems.

Milestones (4-6 months)

"""Over the next 4 to 6 months, Astral will deliver key open-source components and pilots that extend Ethereum’s interoperability and analytics capabilities.
- Launch an open-source Location Proof Plugins Library, enabling multi-signal verification strategies for builders.
- Deploy a public testnet endpoint supporting geofencing, location-based access control, and privacy-preserving verification.
- Pilot a multifactor location proof system for validator node localization and network resilience research.
- Validate compatibility with the Open Intents Framework to ensure cross-standard interoperability.
- Release updated SDK and API documentation supporting permissionless plugin contributions and cross-chain integration.
- Publish the Location Protocol v1.0 specification for ecosystem-wide use and alignment with geospatial standards.


Together, these milestones will make location-based services a practical, interoperable layer for Ethereum developers and researchers."""

Please example how your project meets the round-specific eligibility criteria.

"""Astral meets the round’s eligibility criteria by developing open interoperability standards and infrastructure for verifiable, privacy-preserving geospatial data across Ethereum and L2 networks.

Our open-source SDK, API, and schemas make spatial attestations portable across chains, enabling dApps and intent-based systems to verify real-world context—where and when events occur—in a consistent and trust-minimized way.

Astral advances open data interoperability through standardized schemas grounded in Ethereum’s design principles and aligned with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). These tools strengthen multi-chain coordination by allowing verifiable spatial proofs and analytics to move seamlessly between networks. While distinct from the Open Intents Framework, Astral provides complementary infrastructure that can extend OIF-enabled applications with verifiable real-world context."""
