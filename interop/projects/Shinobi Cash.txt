Shinobi.cash: Borderless Privacy for a Multi-Chain World


Shinobi.cash is a cross-chain privacy protocol enabling users to deposit on one blockchain and withdraw privately on another — with full cryptographic unlinkability between deposits and withdrawals.



By combining zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) with the Open Intent Framework (OIF), Shinobi.cash treats the entire multi-chain ecosystem as one unified privacy set.



Tagline: “Because privacy shouldn’t stop at chain boundaries.”



The Problem



Public blockchains expose every transaction, linkable forever to wallet addresses. This leads to:

Transaction surveillance and deanonymization risks
Fragmented privacy sets — privacy isolated per chain
Poor UX for users moving between chains


Existing privacy solutions like Tornado Cash or Privacy Pool work within a single chain, forcing users to either use bridge during cross-chain operations(Bad UX) or maintain separate privacy pools per chain—severely limiting the anonymity set.



Our Solution



Zero-Knowledge Cross-Chain Privacy

Users deposit on Chain A (e.g., Base) and withdraw privately on Chain B (e.g., Arbitrum).
ZK-SNARKs prove ownership of deposits without revealing identities.
Nullifiers prevent double-spending.
Unified cross-chain pool expands anonymity set across all supported chains.
Decentralized Settlement via OIF

OIF enables intent-based, trustless cross-chain settlement:
Intent-based deposits: Solvers compete to fill user intents; verified by oracles.
Intent-based withdrawals: ZK proofs validate ownership; settlement verified by fill oracles.
No centralized relayers or bridges.
Transparency: All intents public — privacy enforced only through ZK proofs.

OIF provides the infrastructure, not privacy itself — enabling decentralized execution for ZK-based privacy.

Current Status



Deployed & Operational:



✅ Core privacy pool contracts with ZK proof verification
✅ Cross-chain withdrawal via OIF intents
✅ Cross-chain deposits via OIF intents
🚧 Dual oracle validation system (intent + fill) - in progress
🚧 Solver network for intent settlement - in progress
🚧 Web interface for deposit/withdrawal operations - in progress
🚧 Testnet deployment (Base Sepolia ↔ Arbitrum Sepolia) - in progress
Roadmap (3-6 Months)

Milestones (4-6 months)

"""Testnet Deployment: Launch a fully functional cross-chain privacy pool on Ethereum Layer2s (Arbitrum, Optimism), supporting deposits and withdrawals via the Open Intent Framework (OIF), enabling developers and users to experience seamless private transactions across chains.

Smart Contract Audit: Conduct formal audits of all contracts—including entrypoints, settlers, and pool logic—to ensure security, privacy, and ASP compliance.

Open-Source Artifacts: Publish audited contracts, SDKs, and integration guides to allow other projects to build interoperable privacy solutions."""


Please example how your project meets the round-specific eligibility criteria.

"""Shinobi Cash aligns closely with the GG24 Interop Standards, Infra & Analytics criteria by building cross-chain privacy infrastructure using the Open Intents Framework (OIF). Our project:

Advances Interop Infrastructure: Enables intent-based, verifiable, and private fund transfers across EVM chains, including deposits and withdrawals.

Implements Open Standards: Uses OIF for intent propagation, settlement, and solver coordination, demonstrating practical adoption of the framework.
Runs a Pilot for OIF Adoption: Demonstrates real-world multi-chain deposits and withdrawals, showing how OIF can power private, compliant, and decentralized applications.

In short, Shinobi Cash is a public-good, open-source project that strengthens Ethereum’s multi-chain ecosystem, showcases OIF adoption, and provides infrastructure for verifiable, interoperable privacy."""
