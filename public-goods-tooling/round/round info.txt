GG24 Public Goods Tooling Development Round
===========================================

Welcome to your one page guide to the Gitcoin Grant Round 24 **Public Good Tooling Development Round** under the Public Goods R&D domain.

**If** Ethereum public goods tool builders are connected to diverse forms of [capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf) to build stronger network effects, foster deeper collaboration, and enhance interoperability across the ecosystem. **Then** public goods tooling will mature more rapidly and gain broader adoption across traditional markets and local communities. **Because** building resilient and impactful tools depends on trust, and trust grows through collective effort.

How To Participate
==================

The round is split into two paths, **pilot** and **growth **with both focused on the round goals. Each pool uses **[Conviction Voting](https://convictionvoting.wtf/)**, a time based vote. Funded proposals in both pools are eligible for **Retro Rewards, **a performance based bonus.

> Heads up, this page will be updated as the **impact reporting framework finalized** and **retro rewards determined**.

### Who is this for?

-   **Builders of public goods infrastructure on Ethereum**, including capital formation, capital allocation, identity/reputation, impact measurement, and any other tooling that public goods communities count on to effectively fund and coordinate their purpose.

-   **Aspiring public goods builders **looking to connect with the best in the public goods space, either to join an existing project or to fund their own idea for a tool or application build.

### Round Goals

-   **Increase Interoperability** - Support projects integrating with shared public goods primitives

-   **Create Collaborations** - Prioritize teams demonstrating clear cross-project partnerships or co-development

-   **Improve UI/UX** - Fund solutions addressing key public goods UX challenges (for example, community onboarding, identity, or privacy)

-   **Grow Project Maturity** - Back projects with an active roadmap that clearly moves tooling toward their next phase of growth

### Procrastinators Beware

Impact Reporting is due **January 27th**, and Retro Funding will be based on performance of the work completed to that point. **Make sure to scope your proposal to complete within the time window. **Less is more.

### Application Process

1.  Decide what pool to apply for funding **(you can only select one)**

2.  Draft a proposal on the [Greenpill Dev Guild Proposal Page](https://app.charmverse.io/greenpill-dev-guild/proposals)

3.  Submit final proposal on [Gardens platform](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens) **(cannot be edited once submitted)**

4.  Wait to grow enough conviction from the Evaluation Council for your proposal to pass

### Impact Reporting (More Details Soon)

To track progress and measure impact each proposal will require a Karma GAP project to report their activities and milestones. The round will utilize the [Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS)](https://www.commonapproach.org/common-impact-data-standard/) framework for activity reporting which consists of **deliverables** and **metrics.**

The round consists of 4 CIDS activity report structures:

-   **Interoperability**

-   **Collaboration**

-   **UI/UX**

-   **Product Growth**

Funding Paths
=============

Pilot Pool **$15,000**
----------------------

**$1-3k** proposals to incubate innovative new, unproven ideas or small tooling builds with large impact.

**Who's this Pool for?**

-   New builders looking to dive into the Ethereum public goods space

-   Experienced builders with an innovative but unproven idea

**Evaluation Process**

1.  Builders submit an initial draft of their proposal on the Greenpill Dev Guild Charmverse where the community can offer feedback

2.  Builders then post their proposal on Gardens, where proposals are governed by an open community of [Allo Patron NFT](https://www.allo.capital/patron) holders that opt into governance

3.  Retro funding will be awarded based on the success of the project, as reviewed by the Round's Evaluation Council

**How Funds Are Allocated**

-   Proposals request the amount of funding needed to complete the work described

-   More funds requested = more Allo Patron conviction needed to pass

-   Proposals that reach the threshold of conviction are funded

-   Retro funding is distributed in December based on milestone completion and impact reporting

Growth Pool **$70,000**
-----------------------

**$5-10k** proposals addressing known pain points in critical public goods infrastructure or maturing existing tools.

**Who's this Pool for?**

-   Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

-   Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable

**Evaluation Process**

1.  Builders post an initial draft of their proposal on the Greenpill Dev Guild Charmverse where the community can offer feedback

2.  Builders then post their proposal on Gardens, where proposals are governed by the Evaluation Council, a diverse group of builders and researchers with a strong pulse on public goods

3.  Retro funding will be awarded based on the success of the project, as reviewed by the Round's Evaluation Council

**How Funds Are Allocated**

-   Proposals request the amount of funding needed to complete the work described

-   More funds requested = more Evaluation council conviction needed to pass

-   Proposals that reach the threshold of conviction are funded

-   Retro funding is distributed in December based on milestone completion and impact reporting

Retro Rewards **$60,000**
-------------------------

-   In order to qualify for retro a **proposal must be made on Gardens by the October 31st deadline**.

-   If you receive funding from the pilot or growth pool, **you must complete your impact reporting and deliverablesto qualify for retro**.

-   If you submit a proposal and don't get funding, **you must follow the round impact reporting framework and complete deliverables or show substantial progress/growth** to qualify for retro.

-   Retro rewards will be determined in January and announced during the closing ceremony.
