Nymph is a privacy-first, anonymous communication platform designed for Web3 communities and organisations, leveraging zk proofs, ENS identities and on-chain verifiable randomness. The platform allows users to verify their membership in a group or organisation without revealing their actual identity, enabling safe, trustless and anonymous conversations.Key Features:Anonymous ENS / Organisation Verification Users authenticate using Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE, ERC-4361) and we generate a zk-proof ownership of an ENS domain or membership in a specific organisation. zk circuits validate membership without revealing the user's wallet or personal identity. Public & Private Channels -Public Feed: Anyone can post or comment anonymously with a label like someone from base.eth or blocsoc.ethPrivate Channels: Access restricted to verified members of a specific ENS domain or organisation. Anonymous Colour Identity (Pyth Entropy) - In private channels, each user is assigned a unique, randomly generated colour as a persistent pseudonymous identity, each colour generated by a hex code using Pyth Entropy. zkCookies -- Privacy-Preserving Interest TrackingUsers' interactions (comments, posts) are tokenized into keywords. Each keyword's count is stored as a hashed zkState, ensuring the server never sees raw data. Aggregated hashes allow the platform to generate interest-based recommendations or contextual content without compromising anonymity.

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Ethereum has solved many problems (censorship-resistance, programmability, finality), but privacy remains limited. Current privacy solutions are either non-interactive (privacy coins, mixing services) or centralized (relayers, sequencers). Nymph demonstrates something new: privacy built into application logic, verified by Ethereum's existing infrastructure (ENS, on-chain randomness), and scaled to mobile devices. This is privacy that works for real use cases not theoretical, but shipping and in production. Every piece of this can be replicated: ZK proofs on mobile, ENS-based group membership, interest-based systems without data collection. The technical patterns Nymph pioneered become composable building blocks for other Web3 applications. Currently the project is under development and will soon be ready to make good impact in pushing Ethereum's privacy further. The foundation is proven; the scale and adoption phase is next.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Nymph: Anonymous Web3 Social PlatformThe Problem:People inside organizations can't speak freely about internal issues culture problems, technical debt, leadership concerns without fear of retaliation or being identified. Existing anonymous platforms fail because they either don't verify who you are (spam, fake members) or they collect personal data to verify you (defeating anonymity).How It WorksSIWE + ZK Verification: Users sign in with their Ethereum wallet via SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum). This proves they own an address, but the platform never stores that address. Instead, the wallet signature feeds into a ZK circuit that checks: does this address own a domain in the organization's ENS (e.g., blocsoc.eth)? If yes, the circuit generates a proof without revealing which specific address passed. Result: "Someone from blocsoc.eth says..." verified insider, no identity leak.On-Device Interest Proof Generation (zkCookies): The system runs a local classifier on your device that categorizes content you engage with (dog content, car stuff, fitness tips, etc.) as vectors. Instead of sending these vectors to a server, your device generates a ZK proof proving your interest level exceeds a threshold for certain categories. Advertisers query: "Do you meet the criteria [dogs > 80, sports > 10]?" Your phone answers with a cryptographic proof: yes or no. They never see your actual interest vector. The platform verifies the proof is legitimate without learning what you actually care about.The Matcher: The ZK matcher takes your interest proof and compares it against advertiser campaigns. Campaign criteria are hashed on-chain. Matching happens on your device. You see which ads qualified, which didn't, and the match scores full transparency, zero data extraction.Platform Structure:Anonymous Messaging Layer: Private organizational channels verified through ENS domain membership Ephemeral EdDSA keypairs generated after initial SIWE proof no persistent identity tied to activity Messages are your own; the platform can't correlate activity to walletsDual Feed System Public Feed: Community discussions Private Feed: Organization-specific anonymous channels Both feeds support reputation-based filtering (upvotes/downvotes from verified members only)Technical Details:Proof Generation: SIWE signs a message with your wallet Circuit input: wallet address, ENS Merkle tree root (on-chain), user's domain suffix Merkle path lookup proves domain membership without exposing address Output: circom proof that "some valid member of this domain exists" (not which member)Interest Matching: Local classifier generates interest vector [dogs:90, cats:20, sports:10, ...] Device computes ZK proof: H(interests, salt) where score > threshold Matcher receives proof + public input (thresholds, campaign ID) Verifies proof, returns match/no-match + score User sees matched ads with full scoring breakdownWhat Gets Stored: No PII, no emails, no addresses No interest vectors or behavioral data Only: encrypted messages, verified-member feed engagement (upvotes), anonymized proof verification logsWhy This Matters: For Whistleblowing & Feedback: Organizations get honest internal signal without exposing sources. For Advertising: Interest-based targeting works without surveillance infrastructure. Advertisers get qualified leads; users stay anonymous. For Privacy: The system proves you can have both accountability (verified insiders only) and anonymity (no identity leakage). It's shipped and working.
