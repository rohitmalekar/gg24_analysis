A lot of (academic) material exists about ZK and privacy protocols. A lot of handwavy explanations also exist. Between those two worlds is a huge gap.The project consists of articles, social media posts, live presentations, ZK study groups, GitHub repos and other related information that helps to bridge the gap between a beginner ZK nerd and an intermediate one.

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Loads of people have thanked for the material and have found it helpful. Over 200 followers on Medium, 30+ ZK articles.These articles already form a backbone for a further educational journey into ZK and privacy.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

The project has been creating ZK content for over 2 years. The material is humorous enough to be interesting to read, but serious enough to be helpful.Multiple codebases with tutorial / example implementations of various ZK / privacy themes, such as "website age check".
