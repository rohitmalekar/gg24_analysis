Eastore is an open-source, privacy-first decentralized file storage solution built on the Filecoin Onchain Cloud. Our mission is to provide a user experience as seamless and intuitive as traditional Web2 services like Google Drive, while delivering the uncompromising security, privacy, and data sovereignty that only Web3 can offer.At its core, Eastore tackles two critical issues: the systemic risks of centralized cloud storage (data breaches, censorship, lack of ownership) and the high-friction user experience that has hindered the mainstream adoption of decentralized applications.Key Features:

-   Absolute Privacy through Client-Side Encryption: Eastore's foundational principle is zero-knowledge privacy. All files are encrypted directly on the user's device *before* being uploaded. This ensures that no one---not the platform, not the storage providers, nor any third party---can access the file contents. Decryption also occurs entirely on the client side, giving users exclusive control over their data's visibility. With keys being generated through wallet, they are not stored anywhere, leaving no scope of compromise.
-   True Data Sovereignty: By leveraging the Filecoin Onchain Cloud, every user has a direct, on-chain relationship with their chosen Storage Providers. All file metadata and storage deals are recorded on-chain, creating an immutable and verifiable record of ownership that is independent of the Eastore application itself.
-   Chain-Agnostic Interoperability: We are breaking down the walled gardens of the Web3 ecosystem. Eastore is designed to be cross-chain compatible, integrating protocols like Axelar to allow users from any supported blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) to seamlessly pay for storage using their native tokens (ETH, USDC, etc.). This eliminates the need for complex and costly bridging procedures, making decentralized storage universally accessible.
-   Effortless "Drive-Like" Experience: We are abstracting away the complexities of the blockchain. Through features like Session Keys, users can drag-and-drop multiple files for upload without being interrupted by a wallet pop-up for every single transaction, creating a fluid and familiar workflow. Our clean, intuitive interface is designed for everyone, not just crypto-native users.

Eastore is not just another storage application; it is a public good designed to be a foundational layer for a more private, secure, and user-centric internet.

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

The impact of Eastore extends beyond file storage; it is about fundamentally rebalancing the power dynamic between users and platforms, creating a more equitable and resilient digital world.Immediate Impact: Empowering Individual Sovereignty For the end-user, the impact is immediate and profound: the restoration of digital ownership and privacy. In an era of constant data breaches and pervasive surveillance, Eastore provides a sanctuary for personal, professional, and sensitive information. It gives individuals the concrete tools to exercise their right to privacy, transforming them from passive data subjects into sovereign owners of their digital lives. This is critical for users in restrictive environments, journalists protecting sources, and anyone who believes their data should belong to them alone.Ecosystem Impact: Setting a New Standard for dApp Usability and Privacy Eastore's success will demonstrate that privacy and a world-class user experience are not mutually exclusive. By solving key UX challenges like multi-transaction pop-ups and cross-chain friction, we will set a new benchmark for decentralized applications. This will not only drive adoption for Eastore but will also provide a blueprint for other developers, encouraging the entire Web3 ecosystem to build more intuitive, user-centric products. A successful Eastore will prove the viability of truly decentralized, privacy-preserving applications at scale, attracting more builders and users to the space.Long-Term Impact: A Viable Alternative to Big Tech The ultimate impact of Eastore is to provide a credible, scalable, and user-friendly alternative to the centralized cloud monopoly. By combining the global, permissionless storage network of Filecoin with a privacy-first, chain-agnostic application layer, we challenge the notion that users must trade their privacy and ownership for convenience. A thriving Eastore ecosystem will foster competition, reduce systemic risk concentrated in a few large corporations and accelerate the internet's transition towards a more decentralized, equitable, and privacy-respecting architecture for all.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Eastore's contribution is to deliver a foundational piece of public good infrastructure that makes digital self-sovereignty a practical reality for everyone. Our work directly serves the privacy ecosystem by building open, accessible, and censorship-resistant tools that empower individuals.1\. Researching, Implementing, and Open-Sourcing Verifiable Privacy: Our core contribution is the development and open-sourcing of an advanced client-side encryption protocol. We conducted dedicated research to build a system where absolute privacy is the default standard, not an afterthought. Files are encrypted on-device before upload, ensuring zero-knowledge from the platform and storage providers. By making this entire implementation publicly available for audit, review, and reuse, we are contributing a verifiable, foundational privacy tool to the public good. This transparency allows other developers to build upon our work, fostering a stronger, more secure, and collaborative privacy ecosystem.2\. Championing True Decentralization and Censorship Resistance: Unlike many "Web3" applications that rely on centralized gateways or servers, Eastore is architected for maximum decentralization. By facilitating a direct, on-chain relationship between users and a global network of storage providers, we eliminate single points of failure and control. This creates a truly censorship-resistant platform where a user's data cannot be arbitrarily blocked, deleted, or de-platformed.3\. Fostering a More Interoperable and Accessible Web3: Our commitment to cross-chain compatibility is a direct contribution to the public good of the entire blockchain space. By removing the friction of asset bridging, we make premier decentralized storage accessible to a vastly larger audience, promoting a more interconnected, collaborative, and less fragmented Web3. This helps privacy-conscious users from any ecosystem secure their data without being forced into a specific chain.We have opensourced a ton of repositories to allow people to use decentralized private file storage utilities as per their need.
