Fluidkey is a simple, privacy-preserving wallet that allows users to manage their funds onchain and access the full power of DeFi.To preserve privacy, Fluidkey provides each user with an ENS that automatically returns a new stealth address on every query. Each payment received is thereby sent to a fresh address that isn't publicly linked to any of the previously used addresses or the user's public address.Fluidkey is fully self-custodial, built on Safe smart accounts. It supports gas sponsorship, automatic deposits to yield vaults, bank transfers, swaps, and transaction exports.All of the smart contracts and core cryptography have been audited.
