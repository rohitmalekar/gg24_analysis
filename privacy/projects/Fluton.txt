Fluton's mission is to establish privacy as a foundational layer in DeFi & AI. With Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Fluton enables Privacy-Preserving Intent Settlement Mechanism (PRISM), private swaps, private payments and confidential access to existing protocols (Aave and Compound for beta).

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Fluton is enabling intent-based, confidential asset transfers across blockchains. Through encrypted intents powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Fluton bridges the gap between privacy and composability---allowing users and dApps to interact seamlessly and securely across chains without exposing sensitive data.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Fluton introduces a privacy-preserving intent layer that lets users express their goals (e.g., bridging, swapping, staking) without revealing sensitive details. By integrating FHE-based encryption, cross-chain messaging, and solver networks, Fluton enables secure intent execution across multiple chains. Its SDK makes any dApp universally accessible, giving builders a plug-and-play way to add confidential chain-abstracted functionality to their protocols.
