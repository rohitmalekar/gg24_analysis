DASHI - Privacy Infrastructure for Sovereign Health Identity
------------------------------------------------------------

### The Privacy Crisis in Healthcare

Every clinical trial requires patients to expose their most intimate health information---diagnoses, lab results, genetic data---to strangers. This creates a terrible choice: participate in potentially life-saving research or protect your privacy.The cost of this broken system:

-   86% of patients cite privacy concerns as a barrier to participation
-   Centralized medical databases are honeypots for hackers
-   Vulnerable populations avoid trials to protect themselves
-   Innovation slows because researchers can't recruit patients

### Privacy Through Cryptography, Not Policy

DASHI uses zero-knowledge proofs to fundamentally solve this problem. Patients can prove eligibility without revealing private data.Real Examples:

-   ✅ Prove "I'm between 30-45 years old" → Researcher never sees your birthdate
-   ✅ Prove "My cholesterol is below 200 mg/dL" → Researcher never sees your lab results
-   ✅ Prove "I have Type 2 Diabetes" → Researcher never sees your medical history

This isn't privacy through terms of service---it's cryptographic impossibility of data exposure.

### How Privacy is Guaranteed

1\. Zero-Knowledge Proof Circuits

-   Mathematical proofs generated client-side (on patient's device)
-   Researcher verifies proof on-chain without seeing underlying data
-   Technology: Circom + Groth16 (industry-standard ZK stack)
-   Performance: 33-60ms proof generation

2\. Encrypted Medical Vault

-   Patient health data encrypted with patient-only keys
-   Stored on decentralized infrastructure (IPFS)
-   No central database to hack or subpoena
-   Patient can revoke access instantly

3\. Anonymous On-Chain Identity

-   Soulbound tokens (non-transferable health credentials)
-   No correlation between blockchain address and real identity
-   Multi-chain deployment (same privacy across all networks)
-   Zero personal information on public ledger

4\. Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts

-   Study enrollment verified via ZK proofs only
-   Payment milestones without KYC
-   Compliance tracking without surveillance
-   Complete audit trail, zero data leakage

### What Makes DASHI Different

Structural Privacy (not policy-based):

-   ❌ No "we promise not to look"
-   ✅ Cryptographically impossible to access data
-   ❌ No trusted third parties
-   ✅ Patient is sole key holder
-   ❌ No honeypot databases
-   ✅ Decentralized encrypted storage

Privacy by Design Principles:

-   Data minimization: Only proofs transmitted, never raw data
-   Purpose limitation: Each proof is single-use, study-specific
-   Storage limitation: No long-term data retention by researchers
-   Transparency: Open-source code, auditable on-chain logic
-   User control: Patient owns keys, can revoke anytime

### Privacy Technology Stack

Cryptographic Layer:

-   Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Groth16 proving system)
-   Elliptic curve cryptography (bn128 curve)
-   Poseidon hash function (ZK-optimized)
-   Client-side proof generation (no server-side secrets)

Decentralized Storage:

-   IPFS for encrypted medical records
-   Client-side encryption (AES-256)
-   Content addressing (no location metadata)
-   Patient-controlled decryption keys

Blockchain Layer:

-   EVM-compatible smart contracts (Solidity)
-   Soulbound tokens (ERC-721 non-transferable)
-   On-chain proof verification (gas-optimized)
-   Multi-chain deployment (CREATE2 deterministic addresses)

Key Innovation: First production-ready ZK proof system for healthcare privacy at scale.

### Why This Matters

For Patients:

-   Participate in research without privacy sacrifice
-   Own your health data, control access
-   Earn rewards without KYC
-   No risk of data breaches or leaks
