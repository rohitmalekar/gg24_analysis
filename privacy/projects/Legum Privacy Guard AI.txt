Legum PrivacyGuard AI is a privacy-first AI agent platform designed to help regulated organizations such as law firms, fintechs, and healthcare providers use AI safely and lawfully.Legum PrivacyGuard AI addresses a global problem for organizations who want to use AI but face regulatory and ethical risks. By embedding compliance automation into the AI layer, we enable innovation without compromising trust or data rights.The platform provides self-hosted, privacy-preserving AI agents that automate Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), manage user consent, monitor real-time data flows, and enforce privacy-by-design principles while ensuring that no sensitive data ever leaves the user's infrastructure.Built as part of the broader Legum ecosystem, the project combines privacy engineering, AI safety, and legal compliance automation. It is aligned with Gitcoin's public-goods mission by open-sourcing core libraries (for consent management, data leak prevention, and privacy audits) and by training new privacy engineers through the Trailblazer Data Protection Bootcamp in partnership with Tech Minded Lawyers Club (TMLC).
