Shinobi.cash: Borderless Privacy for a Multi-Chain WorldShinobi.cash is a cross-chain privacy protocol enabling users to deposit on one blockchain and withdraw privately on another --- with full cryptographic unlinkability between deposits and withdrawals.By combining zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) with the Open Intent Framework (OIF), Shinobi.cash treats the entire multi-chain ecosystem as one unified privacy set.Tagline: "Because privacy shouldn't stop at chain boundaries."

The ProblemPublic blockchains expose every transaction, linkable forever to wallet addresses. This leads to:

-   Transaction surveillance and deanonymization risks
-   Fragmented privacy sets --- privacy isolated per chain
-   Poor UX for users moving between chains

Existing privacy solutions like Tornado Cash or Privacy Pool work within a single chain, forcing users to either use bridge during cross-chain operations(Bad UX) or maintain separate privacy pools per chain---severely limiting the anonymity set.

* * * * *

Our SolutionZero-Knowledge Cross-Chain Privacy

-   Users deposit on Chain A (e.g., Base) and withdraw privately on Chain B (e.g., Arbitrum).
-   ZK-SNARKs prove ownership of deposits without revealing identities.
-   Nullifiers prevent double-spending.
-   Unified cross-chain pool expands anonymity set across all supported chains.

Decentralized Settlement via OIF

-   OIF enables intent-based, trustless cross-chain settlement:
-   Intent-based deposits: Solvers compete to fill user intents; verified by oracles.
-   Intent-based withdrawals: ZK proofs validate ownership; settlement verified by fill oracles.
-   No centralized relayers or bridges.

Transparency: All intents public --- privacy enforced only through ZK proofs.OIF provides the infrastructure, not privacy itself --- enabling decentralized execution for ZK-based privacy.

Current StatusDeployed & Operational:

-   ✅ Core privacy pool contracts with ZK proof verification
-   ✅ Cross-chain withdrawal via OIF intents
-   ✅ Cross-chain deposits via OIF intents
-   🚧 Dual oracle validation system (intent + fill) - in progress
-   🚧 Solver network for intent settlement - in progress
-   🚧 Web interface for deposit/withdrawal operations - in progress
-   🚧 Testnet deployment (Base Sepolia ↔ Arbitrum Sepolia) - in progress

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

1.  Privacy Infrastructure Impact

-   Exponentially larger anonymity sets: First protocol to unify privacy pools across chains (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.), dramatically increasing privacy guarantees compared to single-chain solutions
-   Eliminates trusted intermediaries: Demonstrates viable alternative to centralized bridges for cross-chain transfers

1.  OIF Ecosystem Impact

-   Demonstrates OIF for complex, privacy-critical app, not just simple token swaps
-   Sets reusable patterns (dual-oracle, solver network)
-   Accelerates adoption through open reference implementation

1.  Ethereum Ecosystem Impact

-   Contributes cross-chain privacy layer to Ethereum
-   Provides SDKs + contracts for developers
-   Advances standards for multi-chain privacy interoperability

1.  User Impact

-   Enables private, cross-chain transfers for individuals, DAOs, and organizations
-   Offers real-world privacy --- for salaries, treasury operations, and donations
