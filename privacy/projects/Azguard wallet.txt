Azguard wallet --- your gateway to the Web3 privacy revolution!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Powered by Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and account abstraction, it gives you complete ownership, privacy, and security --- all in one elegant wallet.

The Essence of Privacy

Aztec isn't just about adding privacy --- it is privacy. Unlike L1 protocols that layer encryption on top, Aztec is built entirely around zero-knowledge cryptography. Every transaction and smart contract runs inside a privacy-native rollup, making your data invisible by design.

Combining Ethereum's security with ZK-powered privacy, Aztec network delivers scalability, EVM compatibility, and built-in compliance --- enabling fast, affordable, and fully confidential DeFi and dApps. Currently in active development and preparing for mainnet launch, Aztec is redefining private blockchain infrastructure.
