Keypo Introduction
==================

Keypo is the easiest way to add end-to-end encrypted access control to your app, with support for any data-type and EVM wallet. We handle encryption, key management, and access control so you can focus on building privacy-first apps:

Key Features
------------

-   Decryption keys are stored in a distributed key management network and never touch your app.
-   Access control logic lives on-chain, owned and defined by the data owner.
-   Encrypted data is stored on IPFS and accessible from any gateway.
-   The SDK is gasless and works with embedded wallets like Privy, including email-based sign-ins.
-   Trusted execution environments (TEEs) enable advanced access controls, like private compute by authorized programs.

Access Control
--------------

-   Users who encrypted data have full, self-custody control over the data.
-   Access controls are mediated by EVM smart contracts.
-   Use share to update access conditions in place on previously encrypted data, without requiring re-encryption.

Wallet Management
-----------------

-   Keypo is compatible with EOAs and the following embedded wallets: Privy, Turnkey and Dynamic.

Contract Addresses (on base sepolia currently)

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Keypo empowers developers to build privacy-preserving, user-owned applications with just a few lines of code.By unifying decentralized key management, programmable access control, and wallet abstraction, Keypo has enabled projects to: - Protect sensitive files, keys, and AI models without exposing raw secrets. - Enforce NFT-based or contract-based access conditions across apps and media. - Deliver seamless user experiences where encryption, decryption, and gas handling happen automatically behind the scenes.This approach transforms encryption and access control into programmable primitives, accelerating the adoption of secure, privacy-respecting technologies across AI, Web3, and data-sharing ecosystems.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Keypo contributes a unified framework for securely gating access to data across any stack --- simplifying the process of integrating encryption, access control, and user authentication.At its core, Keypo: - Simplifies using Lit Protocol for encryption and decentralized key management. - Provides easy-to-use smart contracts for managing access control on-chain. - Uses ZeroDev for account abstraction, so end-users never have to pay gas. - Integrates seamlessly with embedded wallets like Privy, Turnkey, and Dynamic.Together, these components make it possible for developers to securely encrypt data, define complex on-chain or off-chain access conditions, and deliver gated content --- all without needing dedicated servers or centralized trust.
