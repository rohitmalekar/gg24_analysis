WORM implements a practical, deployable alternative to EIP-7503's idea of re-minting secretly-burnt ETH. Rather than changing Ethereum's base protocol, WORM is a separate token that is minted when users irreversibly burn ETH and can later be redeemed or sold back for ETH. Using zero-knowledge proofs, a user proves possession of a valid on-chain burn (an account/state entry containing X ETH that was consumed) without revealing which account or transaction performed the burn, yielding strong plausible deniability: observers cannot distinguish ordinary wallet activity from privacy burns. This approach preserves the privacy goals of EIP-7503 while remaining implementable today as an L2/contracted token, avoiding protocol changes to Ethereum core.

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Our main goal is to:

1.  Introduce the concept of private-proof-of-burn mining to people
2.  Promote the base layer implementation of EIP-7503

We see ourselves as a team which is quite impactful on integration of native privacy into Ethereum.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

We are implementing the very first implementation of an EIP-7503-style privacy protocol. We will build zero-knowledge proof circuits and ERC-20 private-proof-of-burn-mintable token
