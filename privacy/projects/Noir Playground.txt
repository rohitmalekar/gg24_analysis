Noir Playground is a production-grade web application that brings zero-knowledge proof development to the browser, making ZK circuit development accessible without requiring complex local toolchain installation. Built with React + TypeScript and Monaco Editor, it provides a complete development environment for the Noir programming language with professional-grade tooling.The platform features a 5-step execution pipeline (Parse → Compile → Execute → Prove → Verify) powered by @noir-lang/noir_js and @aztec/bb.js (Barretenberg backend). It supports dual compilation modes: server-side native compilation using `nargo compile` CLI (2-5x faster, native git dependency resolution) and browser-based WASM compilation as a fallback.

### Advanced Features

-   Interactive DAP-based debugger with step-through execution, breakpoint management, and real-time variable/witness inspection
-   Circuit complexity profiling with visual heatmaps showing ACIR/Brillig opcodes and gate counts per line
-   External library support with automatic recursive dependency resolution and IndexedDB caching (95% faster subsequent loads)
-   Dynamic input generation from function signatures with intelligent form rendering
-   Code sharing system with Supabase integration and dynamic SEO for social media previews

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

1.  Democratized Zero-Knowledge Development

-   No installation required --- developers can start building circuits instantly
-   Onboarding time reduced from hours → seconds
-   Enables workshops, hackathons, and education without complex setup

1.  Visual Circuit Understanding

-   Real-time profiling visualizes circuit complexity line-by-line
-   ACIR/Brillig gate counts reveal performance hotspots for optimization
-   Makes ZK circuit behavior intuitive and measurable

1.  Streamlined Debugging Workflow

-   Step-through debugging replaces print-based inspection
-   Witness and variable inspection improve comprehension
-   Familiar DAP-based UX reduces friction for new Noir devs

1.  Fostered Ecosystem Growth

-   Integrated with popular Noir libraries (poseidon, noir-bignum, etc.)
-   Dependency caching improves developer retention and productivity
-   MIT-licensed codebase and docs invite open-source collaboration

1.  Performance & Reliability

-   Dual compiler ensures performance (server) and availability (browser fallback)
-   Server-side native compilation achieves 2--5× faster build times
-   Production deployments verified stable under active usage

### Community & Adoption

Noir Playground has gained strong early traction and ecosystem validation:

-   567 unique visitors since launch 2 months ago.

#### 2\. Interactive Debugging System (DAP Protocol)

-   Architected Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) client-server integration for step-by-step circuit execution
-   Implemented DebugContext React state management for session lifecycle, breakpoints, and variable inspection
-   Created VSCode-style debug UI with step controls (next/stepIn/stepOut/continue), current line highlighting, and glyph margin breakpoint indicators
-   Built NoirDebuggerService HTTP client for parallel fetching of variables, witness map, and ACIR opcodes

#### 3\. Real-Time Circuit Complexity Profiling

-   Developed MetricsAggregationService for processing SVG profiler output into normalized heat values (0-1 scale)

-   Created interactive hotspot navigator with click-to-jump functionality for high-complexity line identification
-   Engineered debounced analysis pipeline (1-second delay) with caching for non-blocking UI updates

#### 4\. External Library Dependency System

-   Built DependencyResolverService with recursive git dependency resolution supporting transitive dependencies
-   Implemented DependencyCacheService using IndexedDB with LRU eviction (50MB limit, version-keyed storage)
-   Created GitHub API integration layer for fetching library files from public repositories
-   Designed TOML rewriting system converting git dependencies to path dependencies for noir_wasm compatibility

#### 5\. Unified Server Backend

Repository: [noir-playground-server](https://github.com/0xandee/noir-playground-server)

-   Architected NestJS REST API providing three core services: compilation, profiling, and debugging
-   Implemented NoirServerCompiler with native `nargo compile` execution and automatic git operations
-   Built DAP server handling debug session management, stepping commands, and state inspection
-   Created Docker deployment with pre-built noir-profiler CLI and Barretenberg binaries

#### 6\. Production-Ready Infrastructure

-   Configured Vite WASM support with custom middleware routing and cross-origin isolation headers (CORP/COOP)
-   Implemented code sharing system with Supabase integration and dynamic SEO meta tag generation for social media crawlers
-   Built serverless functions (Vercel/Netlify) for bot detection and dynamic HTML serving
-   Set up automated sitemap generation, Vercel Analytics integration, and responsive UI with mobile warnings
