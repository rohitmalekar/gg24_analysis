[Blockchain-Powered-eSIM](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM)

Allows users to purchase eSIMs plans and subscriptions using both crypto and FIAT, with coverage in over 200 countries through multiple eSIM partners, including special regional and global plans. The app uniquely identifies each user without collecting personal information, provides eSIMs on-the-go, with monthly billing handled by providers in FIAT. It is entirely passwordless and keyless, enabling users to pay and authenticate using biometrics. Smart contracts introduce verifiability, a feature missing in traditional telecom, which enhances interoperability for telecom operators. eSIM plans and amounts are recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and trust. The eSIM Wallet ensures ownership of purchased plans and more, giving users a way to spend their crypto on daily necessities while also upgrading non-crypto users.
