ZK Email is an open source project that enables easy, private identity verification and intuitive email-based wallet management via private proofs of existing email DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signatures. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs, ZK Email authenticates these DKIM signatures to validate specific email content, without exposing the entire email, thereby ensuring both security and privacy. These proofs can be verified on chain directly as well. We have open sourced dozens of unique and optimized primitives in Solidity, Noir, and Circom, and our libraries have been used by hundreds of builders, including ZKP2P and Clave.The ZK Email team shipped a ZK Email Proof Registry at https://registry.zk.email that lets any user upload an email and define a new kind of proof in just 5 minutes, and then anyone can use that proof from the frontend or via the SDK. We also shipped different wallet tooling including email login for wallets (https://jwt.zk.email), 2FA for wallets, and account recovery via emails (https://recovery.zk.email) -- much of it production ready. We have also invested into standards with OpenZeppelin (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/community-contracts/api/utils/cryptography#ZKEmailUtils), and integrations with several projects resulting in tens of thousands of proofs in the real world.We also run the largest public DKIM key archive in the world (https://archive.zk.email) that has over a million keys and helps establish email provenance into the past. We also shipped https://ens.zk.email with ENS that lets anyone verifiably link a social media profile or email address to their ENS names.

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

We have supported $100K+ of transaction volume on ZKP2P, tens of thousands of ZK Email proofs through Jupiter, a new kind of domain marketplace that directly verifies transfer emails, and whistleblowing platforms. Our NPM packages have been installed tens of thousands of times (https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40zk-email) and our smart contracts have been hit thousands of times (https://docs.zk.email/account-recovery/deployed-contracts).
