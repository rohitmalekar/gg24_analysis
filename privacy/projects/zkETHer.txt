Mobile-ZKEther
==============

Mobile-ZKEther is a privacy-preserving ETH transfer protocol designed for mobile-first environments.\
It offers Tornado Cash--like anonymity with major improvements in usability, receiver privacy, no off-chain notes exchange and mobile accessibility --- bringing private Ethereum transactions to everyone, everywhere.

* * * * *

### What it does

Mobile-ZKEther enables private, receiver-aware ETH transfers where only the intended receiver can detect and spend funds --- without revealing the recipient address on-chain.Users deposit ETH into a shielded pool, generating receiver-aware notes.\
Proof generation happens directly on-device using [MoPro](https://zkmopro.org/), a mobile proving framework optimized for low-latency ZK circuits.Withdrawals are gasless via relayers, maintaining both privacy and ease-of-use.\
All metadata exchange occurs off-chain through encrypted memos and tag buckets, which let recipients automatically discover incoming funds privately.

* * * * *

### Technical Summary

Mobile-ZKEther's protocol flow follows a fully auditable, cryptographically-sound pipeline:

1.  Deposit:\
    Sender (Alice) deposits a fixed-denomination note tied to an ephemeral `R_pub`, computing commitments using Poseidon2 and HKDF-derived secrets.
2.  Off-chain Discovery:\
    Alice uploads an encrypted memo and tag to a relay. Receiver (Bob) queries only relevant tag buckets, decrypts, and recovers his note.
3.  Proof Generation:\
    Bob proves knowledge of `(secret, nullifier)` via a MoPro-compiled ZK circuit --- proving Merkle inclusion and nullifier uniqueness.
4.  Gasless Withdrawal:\
    Bob signs a relayRequest containing proof and withdrawal details; relayer posts the transaction, earning a fee while Bob stays anonymous.

* * * * *

### Cryptography and Circuits

-   Key exchange: X25519
-   Hash & commitments: Poseidon2 (ZK-friendly)
-   KDF: HKDF-SHA256
-   Signatures: Ed25519 / ECDSA (deterministic)
-   ZK Backend: MoPro for mobile provers
-   Merkle Tree Depth: Configurable (20 levels ≈ 1 M notes)

* * * * *

### Why It's Better Than Tornado Cash

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Mobile-ZKEther aims to redefine financial privacy on Ethereum by making zero-knowledge--based private transfers usable, mobile, and accessible to everyone --- not just technically advanced users.While privacy protocols like Tornado Cash demonstrated the potential of zero-knowledge proofs for anonymity, they left critical usability and accessibility gaps that limited real-world adoption. Mobile-ZKEther fills those gaps by rethinking private transfer architecture from the ground up, introducing receiver-aware design, mobile proof generation, and gasless interactions --- all while maintaining robust cryptographic security.

* * * * *

#### Democratizing On-Chain Privacy

Privacy on Ethereum is currently exclusive --- it assumes users have desktop machines, strong technical literacy, and can handle complex note management. Mobile-ZKEther changes this paradigm by enabling private, gasless ETH transfers directly from mobile devices.Our integration with MoPro allows zero-knowledge proofs to be generated efficiently on smartphones, which brings Ethereum-level privacy to billions of mobile users worldwide. This accessibility layer is critical to Ethereum's long-term vision of global inclusivity, where privacy is not a privilege but a baseline right.By making privacy accessible to anyone with a mobile device, Mobile-ZKEther turns private transactions into an everyday behavior --- not a niche use case.

* * * * *

#### Expanding the Ethereum Privacy Stack

The project contributes a novel, modular protocol that can serve as a privacy primitive for the wider ecosystem. Developers can integrate Mobile-ZKEther into wallets, DeFi apps, and social protocols as a plug-and-play privacy layer.This architecture introduces:

-   Receiver-aware notes: enabling private detection without out-of-band note exchange.
-   Encrypted memos and tag buckets: a scalable, privacy-preserving message discovery layer.
-   Relayer network architecture: enabling gasless, anonymized withdrawals.
-   Open SDK and circuit specs: empowering other teams to build on top of our model.

The result is not just a single dApp, but a mobile privacy infrastructure that others can adopt, fork, and extend --- similar to how Tornado Cash became the foundation for many privacy extensions, but designed for the next era of mobile-first, scalable Ethereum.

* * * * *

#### Measurable Impact

We evaluate our impact across accessibility, privacy strength, and composability:

-   Accessibility: Any user with a mobile phone can generate proofs and transact privately without running heavy infrastructure.
-   Privacy Strength: Receiver-aware notes ensure no correlation between deposits and withdrawals; encrypted discovery prevents leakage via metadata.
-   Composability: The protocol is designed for L2 and cross-chain deployment, ensuring longevity and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem.
-   Ecosystem Utility: Open-source SDKs, contract interfaces, and APIs allow developers to integrate Mobile-ZKEther directly into their apps and wallets.

Our long-term goal is for Mobile-ZKEther to become a standardized privacy building block in the Ethereum stack --- powering everything from stealth donations to privacy-preserving DeFi interactions.

* * * * *

#### Philosophical Impact

At its core, Mobile-ZKEther reinforces Ethereum's foundational value: "freedom to transact privately."\
It transforms the abstract concept of zero-knowledge privacy into a tangible, usable, and decentralized experience --- one that can be deployed on any device, by any user, anywhere in the world.By making privacy both usable and open-source, we hope to set a new UX and security standard for privacy protocols, ensuring that financial confidentiality remains a fundamental right within the decentralized web.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Mobile-ZKEther contributes a new architecture and open specification for private Ethereum transfers that merge zero-knowledge cryptography, mobile optimization, and receiver-aware design.\
It evolves Tornado Cash's original concept into a modern, developer-friendly, and user-centric protocol built for the mobile era.

* * * * *

#### Core Technical Contributions

1.  Receiver-Aware Note System\
    Traditional mixers like Tornado Cash rely on the sender to manually share a "note" that the receiver uses to withdraw.\
    Mobile-ZKEther eliminates this manual exchange by introducing receiver-aware notes, cryptographically bound to the recipient's viewing key.\
    This means only the intended receiver can detect and spend funds --- vastly improving security and UX.
2.  Encrypted Memo + Tag Bucket Discovery\
    A new off-chain event discovery layer based on encrypted memos indexed by tag buckets.\
    Receivers can privately scan relevant tags to identify incoming transfers without revealing metadata or requiring trusted servers.\
    This design provides scalable, private message discovery even for large anonymity sets.
3.  On-Device Proof Generation via MoPro\
    Proof generation no longer requires a server or desktop node.\
    Through MoPro integration, all zkSNARK proofs are generated locally on mobile hardware, reducing latency and trust while improving accessibility.\
    This approach proves that mobile ZK systems are production-ready, pushing the boundaries of lightweight proving frameworks.
4.  Gasless, Privacy-Preserving Relayer Framework\
    Introduces a relayer architecture where withdrawals can be executed without the receiver paying gas --- while maintaining unlinkability between the relayer and user.\
    It uses signed `relayRequests` verified in-circuit to ensure privacy and prevent front-running.\
    This makes private withdrawals both gasless and seamless.
5.  Open Cryptographic Specification\
    All primitives are defined using Poseidon2, HKDF, and X25519 for ZK-friendly efficiency and forward secrecy.\
    The protocol defines open specs for Merkle tree structure, nullifier computation, and proof verification --- ensuring full transparency and verifiability for external auditors and contributors.

* * * * *

#### Long-Term Ecosystem Contributions

1.  Expanding Privacy to L2s and Rollups\
    Designed for extension to rollup environments (Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync), Mobile-ZKEther creates a framework for privacy that is L2-compatible by design, not as an afterthought.
2.  Public Goods and Reusability\
    By publishing an open, modular protocol, Mobile-ZKEther provides reusable primitives --- note generation, encrypted memo patterns, and mobile proof tooling --- that other teams can leverage in wallets or DeFi protocols.
3.  Strengthening Ethereum's Privacy Layer\
    Mobile-ZKEther enhances Ethereum's credibility as a privacy-supportive ecosystem by demonstrating that privacy and usability can coexist.\
    This project helps move Ethereum away from the perception that privacy tools are inaccessible, complex, or legally risky --- instead showing privacy as an integrated, user-centric, open-source primitive.

* * * * *

#### Vision of Contribution

Ultimately, Mobile-ZKEther's contribution lies in creating a human-centric privacy stack --- where the cryptography is strong, the UX is effortless, and privacy becomes an invisible, default property of every transaction.\
It reimagines Tornado Cash's legacy through a lens of accessibility, open research, and responsible innovation --- ensuring the future of private Ethereum remains decentralized, ethical, and usable.
