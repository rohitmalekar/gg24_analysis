Eppie --- a privacy-first P2P email that works with Gmail, Proton, Ethereum, and more🦄
=====================================================================================

Eppie is an encrypted peer-to-peer email where privacy is not an option but the foundation. Eppie supports both traditional email (Gmail, Outlook, Proton, etc.) and crypto addresses. You can turn your Ethereum address into a private inbox and receive secure messages from Gmail! No private data ever lands on any server. And we're getting ready to launch public Testnet!Support development with Gitcoin Grants 24!🚀

Designed differently⚙️
----------------------

We're shifting email from provider-centric approach to a user-owned one, offering state-of-the-art privacy and control over communication. Messages are end-to-end encrypted using ECIES (secp256k1), fragmented, and distributed across the network. No one -- not even us, Eppie's developers -- can access user data or trace communications. Here's how Eppie works compared to traditional centralized mail system:

-   Provider-rented address → User-owned crypto-like address;
-   Emails routed through a provider → Emails transmitted peer-to-peer;
-   Data stored on provider's server → Local and decentralized storage;

### IMPACT STATEMENTS

Eppie is still in the prototype stage, but we've already demonstrated tangible progress and early adoption. Our preview desktop app for Windows, Linux, and macOS has attracted over 1,500 active users who test encryption, Proton Mail integration, and early decentralized messaging features. This growing community provides valuable feedback that helps us refine the app before public Testnet launch.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Eppie contributes to the Ethereum ecosystem by developing open, privacy-preserving communication infrastructure. It introduces a decentralized messaging protocol that connects Ethereum addresses, wallets, and users through encrypted peer-to-peer channels. By enabling wallets to act as secure mailboxes, Eppie expands Ethereum's utility beyond transactions -- into private human-to-human and dApp-to-user communication. Also, Eppie lowers the entry barrier to Web3 by letting anyone create and use an Ethereum address directly from their email app --- bringing new users into the Ethereum ecosystem through everyday communication. All code and specifications are open source and can be reused by other developers to build privacy tools or integrate secure messaging into their apps.
