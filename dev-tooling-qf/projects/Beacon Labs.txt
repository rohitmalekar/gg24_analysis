Beacon Labs (prev Fracton Research) is an R&D institution for a positive sum world through exploring inclusive coordination design. We will bring plural funding mechanisms reflected plural values into a public goods space. We enable funding based on diverse value systems through a statistical approach. Current public goods funding makes a decision based on a single value framework, even though public goods has different outcomes which they would like to achieve. We envision a future where each public good receives funding optimized for its own unique goals, and we aim to build protocols that support Ethereum to thrive sustainably.

We reflect the diversity of values they embody through evaluating and measuring the impact of public goods and funding mechanisms. While impact evaluation / measurement has been developed in recent years, most progress has focused on measuring the impact of OSS(open-source software). In contrast, there is a lack of evaluating non-technical activities such as educational influence and contributions to local communities. We envision a future where public goods can grow sustainably toward their respective goals by using outcome metrics tailored to each project.

By pursuing funding mechanisms that reflect plural values and provide a greater sense of fairness and legitimacy, we bring new light to the Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s build for a positive-sum world together.
