Vyper is a pythonic smart contract programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Vyper contracts secure more than $4 billion across multiple chains for major protocols such as Curve, Lido and Yearn.

It is currently the second most popular EVM programming language.

Vyper is an open-source project maintained by a core team of experienced web3 engineers and a number of volunteer contributors. We collaborate extensively with partners across the EVM toolchain, infrastructure, and security ecosystems.

Vyper aims to become the leading choice for smart contract development by offering:

- Superior developer experience through pythonic syntax and extensive tooling
- Enhanced security with a safe-by-default approach that removes common security footguns
- Maximum readability, making contracts easier and cheaper to audit
- Optimized performance with 50% smaller bytecode and lower gas costs
- Easy onboarding for Python developers

To do so, we are currently working on:

- Improving compiler security through regular, extensive audits, automated testing and the use of formal verification methods
- Implementing new features (struct packing, traits, generics) to make the language more powerful for developers
- Enhancing developer tools and framework integration (Titanoboa, Moccasin, Snekmate)
- Continuous improvement of compiler optimization through the Venom backend
- Building better documentation and learning resources
