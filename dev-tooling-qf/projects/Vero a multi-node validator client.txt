Vero is a multi-node validator client designed to protect validators from client bugs. It does this by cross-checking the blockchain state across multiple client implementations before submitting attestations.

How does Vero help Ethereum?

Voting for an incorrect chain can have disastrous for Ethereum validators – in the worst case, all of their locked up ETH can get slashed. By using Vero, Ethereum validators can avoid voting for an incorrect chain by getting a sort of "second opinion" before they attest.

Is Vero production-ready?

Yes, Vero is production-ready! Vero is already making over thirty thousand validators more resilient to client bugs, across both Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.

What is coming up for Vero?

As a validator client, Vero needs to stay up-to-date with the latest network upgrades. We have recently added support for the upcoming Fusaka network upgrade, and will start working on the Glamsterdam network upgrade soon.
