simple-optimism-node is a Docker Compose script that lets you spin up OP Stack full or archive nodes (Optimism, Base, etc.) with one command. It’s the officially documented “quick start” path in Optimism’s node-operator tutorials.

Adoption is broad across the Superchain ecosystem and the repo shows active maintenance with strong community uptake (~409 stars and 158 forks).

simple-optimism-node is being forked by Celo to serve as their official node launch script.

Follow these steps to get your Optimism full node running in seconds and to complete synchronization in less than a day using Snap Sync:

# 1) Clone and enter git clone https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node.git cd simple-optimism-node
# 2) Configure from the sample cp.env.example.env # Edit.env: # NETWORK_NAME=op-mainnet # or op-sepolia, base-mainnet, base-sepolia # NODE_TYPE=full # or archive # OP_NODE__RPC_ENDPOINT=<your L1 RPC> # OP_NODE__L1_BEACON=<your L1 beacon endpoint>
# 3) Start (detached) and build latest images docker compose up -d --build

When updating, pull and rebuild:

git pull && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate

The simple-optimism-node project was originally developed by smartcontracts and has since been further developed by me, Chomtana.
