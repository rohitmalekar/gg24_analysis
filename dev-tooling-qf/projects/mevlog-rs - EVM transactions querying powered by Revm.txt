mevlog-rs is a CLI for querying EVM transactions. When working on an MEV bot, I found it surprisingly difficult to quickly find txs matching specific criteria. I wrote many one-off query scripts and ended up wrapping them into an easy-to-reuse tool. I started building mevlog to work as an "SQL for blockchain".

I find the workflow of using centralized 3rd-party explorers for browsing EVM chains data far from optimal. Even Etherscan is often unresponsive or randomly blocks access. When working on web3 projects, I prefer to have all my tooling accessible within a terminal. mevlog fills an important gap in the web3 dev ecosystem. There's no other open-source tool that allows cherry-picking EVM transactions with similar accuracy. It's compatible with every EVM chain and integrated with ChainList public RPCs registry.

I've recently released a web version hosted on https://mevlog.rs/. As a subsequent iteration of the project, I want to implement a full-blown TUI (Terminal User Interface) using the https://ratatui.rs/ library. A key advantage of the TUI over the hosted web version is the reduced risk of throttling on public RPCs. Additionally, more security-aware users are more likely to trust software that runs 100% in environments they control. Combined with performance benefits like local caching, the TUI is an ideal frontend for a blockchain explorer and querying tool.
