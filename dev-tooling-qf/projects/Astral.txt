Location-Based Services for Ethereum

The missing location layer for Web3 — making “where” a first-class primitive in decentralized systems.

Astral provides open infrastructure that lets dApps represent and reason about where things happen, unlocking a new class of location-aware applications on Ethereum.

Why It Matters

Location shapes many of the world’s most engaging digital experiences—mobility, gaming, social coordination, and discovery—but remains inaccessible to Web3.

Today, apps rely on inconsistent or easily spoofed signals, with no shared standard for expressing where something happened.

Astral changes that.

We’re developing a framework for location proofs —verifiable attestations that confirm location or region membership—and a network of interoperable location services that make it simple for developers to build spatially aware applications.

What’s Live

- Astral SDK: Developer tools for creating verifiable location data attestations — onchain and offchain.
- Astral API: A geospatial indexer for reading and validating signed spatial data.

What's Next

- Location Proof Plugins Library: Extensible library for collecting location evidence for believable location claims.
- Astral Location Services: A geofencing and verification layer for dApps, supported by GG24 funding.

What You Can Build

- Social and cultural apps that activate based on verified presence
- Games and quests that reward real-world exploration
- Coordination and field tools for logistics, research, or response
- Agents and AI systems that adapt to real-world context
- Community or DAO applications that respond to place-based participation

Why Now

- Ethereum’s stack — L2s, AVSs, zk systems — is mature enough to support verifiable real-world interaction.
- The network’s multi-chain architecture calls for shared context standards like Astral’s.
- Users and developers need interoperable ways to anchor digital activity in geography, without sacrificing control.
- Astral Location Services provide a common foundation for location-aware logic across chains and ecosystems.
