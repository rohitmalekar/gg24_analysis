Over 300 downloads, the most used Stateful Fuzzing Smart Contract Testing Framework!

The Recon Extension allows you to quickly scaffold and run Invariant Testing with Echidna, Medusa and Halmos.

Leveraging the Chimera Framework, the extension makes you write Foundry tests, which can then be run with other specialized tools.

When a property breaks, you can immediately debug it using Foundry, making the best out of all tools.

## Features

The Recon extension is a VS Code extension that streamlines smart contract testing by providing:

- **One-click setup**: Automatically install and configure [Chimera]( https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/chimera) templates

- **Integrated fuzzing**: Run [Echidna]( https://github.com/crytic/echidna), [Medusa]( https://github.com/crytic/medusa) and [Halmos]( https://github.com/a16z/halmos) directly from VS Code

- **Contract explorer**: Browse and select target contracts and functions

- **Fuzzer integration**: Quick access to fuzzing tools directly through the extension

- **Coverage visualization**: View and analyze code coverage from fuzzers

- **Test generation**: Generate Foundry unit tests from call sequences that break properties found by the fuzzer

- **Log to Foundry Repro converter**: Convert Echidna and Medusa logs to Foundry test reproductions with customizable VM options

- **Link Libraries (Experimental)**: Automatically detect and configure library dependencies for Echidna and Medusa

- **Mock/TargetFunctions generation**: Easily create mock contracts and target functions for testing

- **CodeLens integration**: Run tests and modify function behaviors directly in the editor
