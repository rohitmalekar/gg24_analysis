rotki is a fully opensource (AGPL) portfolio tracking, accounting & management app that puts users first. Unlike most financial apps, rotki never extracts your data, never locks you into someone else’s system, and never monetizes your privacy. It’s local-first software: your entire financial history lives on your machine, under your control.

In a world where most crypto apps are cloud-based and data-hungry, rotki is different. It’s an aligned app, built to serve its users, not exploit them.

Why rotki matters

Crypto is spread across centralized exchanges, multiple chains, and countless protocols. The result: a chaotic mess of wallets, trades, and balances. rotki brings clarity and control:

- Unified portfolio view across exchanges, blockchains, and DeFi protocols.
- Historical insight into your entire crypto journey: profits, losses, and positions.
- Accounting & reporting tools that help you share results with an accountant without ever giving up your private data.
- Privacy by design: no trackers, no hidden APIs, no accounts in someone else’s database.

Where we’re going

rotki is already the most advanced local-first portfolio manager, but the vision is much bigger:

- More supported protocols, chains, and integrations.
- Smarter search, filtering, and analytics.
- Portfolio management features that let users act, not just observe.
- Continued innovation around privacy-preserving, user-aligned financial tools.

Why support matters

Because rotki refuses to monetize users through ads, lock-ins, or surveillance, we rely on community funding to keep the project alive. Donations directly support development, maintenance, and new features ensuring rotki remains independent, transparent, and aligned with its users.

By supporting rotki, you’re not just funding one app. You’re helping prove that aligned apps can survive and thrive: software that empowers people without exploiting them.
