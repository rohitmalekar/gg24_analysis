We are a community of builders supporting Greenpill Chapters and regen communities with regenerative tools, guides, and workshops focused on impact measurement, community coordination, capital allocation and capital formation. Since October 2023, the Greenpill Dev Guild has nurtured a thriving community through weekly meetings, impactful workshops, and collaborative projects that members actively contribute to. The Guild operates several grant rounds with Grant Ships, Gitcoin, and Allo Alliance, funding regenerative initiatives across gaming, biodiversity, and public goods spaces. Join us in advancing the regen movement and amplifying meaningful impact!

🎯Mission

We aim to foster positive-sum actions where impact = profit, ensuring that meaningful change and prosperity go hand in hand as we work together to defeat Moloch.

♻️ Our Regenerative Stack

The Regenerative Stack connects blockchain infrastructure, onchain protocols, social governance, and impactful applications, creating a holistic cycle that funds and sustains regeneration.

🌿 Green Goods

Green Goods revolutionizes biodiversity conservation by bringing ecological data on-chain, enabling transparent impact tracking and rewarding conservation efforts. Built as a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA), it provides verifiable impact attestations, driving funding and community engagement toward ecological initiatives.

⭐ GreenWill

GreenWill is a user-friendly mini-app enabling Greenpill members and regen leaders to earn and showcase verifiable credentials for their regenerative actions. It makes reputation tracking seamless and shareable, enhancing cross-community recognition and engagement.

🌐 Allo Alliance

The Allo Alliance pioneers novel on-chain capital allocation mechanisms, including quadratic funding, conviction voting, and gamified grant distributions, to transparently and effectively channel resources to high-impact regenerative projects.

🖥️ Squad Staking

Squad Staking democratizes Ethereum staking through collective participation, significantly reducing barriers to becoming validators. It provides perpetual, community-directed funding streams for public goods by allocating a portion of staking yields directly to regenerative projects

📈 Allo Advancement

Allo Advancement is a project that fosters the growth of the Allo protocol by operating a Gitcoin grant round to fund builders growing the protocol. This initiative connects builders across the Allo ecosystem and supports the continued development of grants through Gitcoin RFPs and community rounds.

🪸 Impact Reef

Impact Reef is designed to capture qualitative data for public good projects, backed by community endorsements. This initiative aims to surface the value and impact of these projects, making it easier for them to gain additional funding and support.

🚢 Grant Ships

Grant Ships is a grant allocation game where the Greenpill Dev Guild competes with other allocators to fund games on Arbitrum. Using a retroactive and proactive funding mechanism, the Guild helps bring regenerative features into games, turning degens into regens and demonstrating the effectiveness of our unique funding model.
