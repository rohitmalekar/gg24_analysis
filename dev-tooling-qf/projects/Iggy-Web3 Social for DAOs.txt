Iggy is a free, open-source Web3 framework for easily creating social apps for communities, featuring optional plugins like a token swap, NFT launchpad, and more.

Think of Iggy as “ Wordpress for Web3 Social ”. A web3 framework that lets you easily set up a Web3 Social app for your community.

Open Source and Free

Iggy is completely free to use! The code is open source and available on GitHub:

The Iggy framework includes many useful plugins that go beyond just a social app, such as a token swap module, NFT launchpad module, Send Tokens module, etc.

These modules are all optional and developers can decide on their own which ones to use (or even develop new ones).
