TL;DR

DeVouch brings trust to Web3 funding by letting verified ecosystem members vouch for or flag projects through onchain attestations, building transparent, community-driven reputations that help funders back credible builders. devouch.xyz

🧩 Problem

In the Web3 ecosystem, hundreds of projects compete for grants and donations, but assessing their credibility is difficult.

Platform, Grantors and donors struggle to assess the impact of projects and grantees, leaving funders uncertain and genuine builders undervalued.

It lets trusted community members, such as Optimism delegates, badgeholders, Giveth and DAOs, vouch for or flag projects through on-chain attestations, creating an open and verifiable layer of reputation.
