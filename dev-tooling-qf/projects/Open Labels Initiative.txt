The Open Labels Initiative tackles the issue of isolated and non-standardized datasets of address labels within the blockchain community. It introduces a flexible, open and community owned framework for anyone to use and contribute to.

By aligning on a single framework for address labels, we avoid redundant work and make it easier to share datasets within the community.

The OLI repository functions as the community maintainer. Additionally, it serves as a neutral entity that provides tooling to get started.

The 3 Pillars of OLI Framework

- 1) Label Schema: We should all speak the same language when it comes to labels. The first step is implementing a unified data model that enables seamless synchronization of labels across different databases and ensures alignment on value sets.

- 2) Label Pool: Sharing labels in a decentralized manner is the next logical step. Using attestations, we've created a pool of raw labels that anyone can contribute to. By consolidating all labels in one place, both labellers and data teams can share their work, reducing redundant work. All attestations will remain permanently accessible, fostering a collaborative, community-driven labeling effort.

- 3) Label Trust: Trust algorithms optimized for specific use cases are applied to the raw labels contributed to the Label Pool. In doing so, raw labels are transformed into valuable, use-case-specific labels—optimized for analytics, security, and beyond.

The three pillars of OLI are designed to build on one another, like stacking Lego blocks. At the base lies the OLI Label Schema, providing the core structure. On top of that comes the Label Pool, which enables broad collaboration and sharing. Finally, the Label Trust layer builds on both to establish confidence and reliability. You don’t need to adopt all three pillars at once, start small and implement only what you need.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This sounds great, how can I get started / participate?

Great to hear! To stay updated on the latest happenings, feel free to join our monthly OLI calls. You can also start submitting labels through our frontend or by using one of our bulk attestation scripts. If you’re just interested in reading labels from the label pool, you can access them via a GraphQL endpoints.

Who will submit labels to the OLI Label Pool?

We identified three core user groups among label submitters, which primarily differ in the volume of labels they contribute.

Why should I submit my labels to the OLI label pool?

This is a public, open initiative designed to break down data silos and empower everyone with higher-quality labels. The more people who contribute, the higher the quality of the labels—and the more possibilities they unlock.

While OLI itself will not sponsor participants, we aim to maintain complete transparency about the number of labels contributed by different teams and individuals. This transparency can serve as a qualifying factor for public goods funding rounds such as Gitcoin, Optimism Retro Funding, Octant, and many more.

Why do you use attestations for data entry / label submission?

Attestations are a powerful tool for standardizing data entry while cryptographically verifying who submitted each label. This enables anyone to build robust trust algorithms that boost confidence in the submitted labels.

Can every label in the label pool be blindly trusted?

No. Currently, these labels are raw and haven't undergone any additional trust verification. A straightforward trust layer involves relying solely on labels submitted by verified, whitelisted entities — a process made easy since every label is associated with an attestation. Looking ahead, we plan to develop trust algorithms tailored to specific use cases. All future tools related to this will be made available here.

I want to submit metadata, but I couldn't find a fitting tag in the data model. What should I do?

Great! Simply open a pull request to our tag_definitions.yml file in this repository and include an explanation for why this tag should be added to OLI. We'll periodically review all new tags and incorporate them into the schema.

How can I access the labels in the OLI Label Pool?

There are multiple ways to access all labels in the OLI Label Pool, please see tooling documentation.
