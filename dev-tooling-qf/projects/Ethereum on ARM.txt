Help us to build a ~$175 PnP Ethereum full/archive/staking L1 and L2 nodes based on ARM boads that uses only ~10 watts of power to run.

Ethereum on ARM provides a PnP Ubuntu server image for the Rock 5B, Orange Pi 5, Orange Pi 5 plus and NanoPC-T6 that run both Execution and Consensus clients as a Systemd services and automatically turns the device into a full Ethereum EL+CL node or a home staking box.

This is what we've been at these last months:

- Support and include more Ethereum clients. Current list: Geth, Erigon, Besu, Nethermind, Reth, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Lodestar and Lighthouse
- Support to L2 solutions: Optimism, Starknet, Gnosis, Polygon, Arbitrum and Base
- Testing and releasing an image for the Rock 5B, Orange Pi 5 Plus, Raspberry Pi 5, and NanoPC-T6
- Documentation update
- Research and include other blockchain components in the image: Swarm & Status
- RISC V: Continue to research and try to run an node on this architecture. First working Node on Vision Five 2.
- EOA-Config: A new GUI to get a node up and running very easily
- DVT: Distributed validator technology and Liquid Staking

Other info:

We are running a $175 Ethereum stake board device with 4 validators using 10 watts along with 12 validators in Lido CSM module.
