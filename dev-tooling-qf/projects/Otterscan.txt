Introduction

An opensource, private, self-hosted block explorer for EVM chains

Description

Otterscan is the most affordable way for regular people to run a mainnet block explorer locally. Since everything is local, everything is fast, private, and it runs on consumer grade hardware.

It is built on top of Erigon, currently the only ETH client able to run an archive node on consumer grade hardware (syncs in 1 day, takes ~1.8 TB; regular external SSDs do the work).

Otterscan implements some non-standard JSON-RPC methods to extract additional information (e.g. internal ETH transfers) directly from Erigon DB.

Then, we use this data with other public datasets (4bytes, Sourcify) to provide a 100% local block explorer. It is a SPA and requires only an Erigon archive node, no additional middleware (SQL DBs, indexers) is necessary.

It supports open standards like ENS, and widespread sources of info like Chainlink for getting historical price info directly from the archive, no external sources are needed.

Community members have even made it available into a dappnode package.

Problems we are trying to solve

Privacy

No info about your addresses is leaked to third-parties.

Availability

It runs against your node, as long as it has internet connectivity, the service is never down.

Consumer hardware friendly

Most opensource solutions out there have large hardware requirements, making it unaffordable to run it at home.

Expand the API ecosystem

Something simple as getting the transactions from your addresses often requires using a third-party, centralized, closed source indexer.

We solved that problem for Otterscan by exposing that info directly from the node, and everyone can benefit from it.
