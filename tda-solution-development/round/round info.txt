# Solution Development Grants (GG24)

The **Solutions Development Grants** **Program** is a targeted **$150K **development grant program dedicated to providing resources and support for proven, onchain solutions to develop new SDG-aligned features enabling expansion and growth into new markets. 

Approved projects will receive a milestone-based grant of up to $25K and hands-on support from the Ethereum For The World network. In late Q1 2026, projects will receive additional rewards based on their progress and impact as measured through the onchain accountability solution, Karma GAP.

This program is part of [Gitcoin Grants 24 (GG24)](https://www.gitcoin.co/), a larger initiative by [Gitcoin](https://www.fortheworld.eco/ecosystem/gitcoin) to realize the potential of Ethereum to impact the world through targeted development and adoption campaigns. The round is co-funded and supported by [Celo](https://www.fortheworld.eco/ecosystem/celo), the[ Ethereum](https://www.fortheworld.eco/ecosystem/ethereum) Foundation, and [Ma Earth](https://maearth.com/). Ethereum For The World, together with Celo Public Goods, leads operations.

**Program Scope**
-----------------

Projects considered for the Solutions Development Grants Program will be evaluated based on the following core criteria, designed to optimize for real-world impact, scalability, and ecosystem legitimacy:

**SDG Alignment:** Must directly support one or more SDGs with measurable social or environmental impact.

**Scalability:** Should demonstrate potential for expansion and broad adoption.

**Innovation & Feature Expansion:** Introduce new functionality or integrations that enhance SDG impact, leveraging Ethereum for efficiency and transparency.

**Sustainability & Adoption Pathways:** Present clear plans for long-term growth, adoption, and community engagement, with preference for proven traction.

**Open-Source, Onchain Orientation:** Must be open-source and onchain to ensure transparency, auditability, and accessibility.

**Application Process and Timeline**
------------------------------------

The program consists of four phases between October 2025 and March 2026:

1.  **Initial Intake:** Projects have up to October 19th, 23:59 UTC to complete the SDG program intake form, which requests basic information about the project and a high-level description of their prospective application. Up to 12 projects will be selected to move to the next phase.\
    ‍
2.  **Formal application and vote: **Projects have two weeks to expand on their grant application and make a final submission. A group of experts will review all proposals using Conviction Voting, a system that funds proposals based on the aggregated preference of members via the [Gardens solution](https://www.gardens.fund/) to make the final selection of projects to be funded.

3.  **Development phase:** Projects will have 4 months to complete R&D efforts and begin leveraging their new features to expand into new markets. During this phase, they will have access to the network and expertise of Ethereum For The World.

4.  **Impact Assessment and Rewards:** In late March 2026, projects' development and impact---as tracked via [Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/)---will be reviewed to allocate impact-based bonus funding. Results will be consolidated in an Impact Report, shaping future Ethereum For The World programs.
