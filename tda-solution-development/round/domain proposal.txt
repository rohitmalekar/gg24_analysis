A. Solution Development Grants
------------------------------

The Solution Development Grants Program allocates targeted development and expansion funding to 6--10 proven, onchain, open-source solutions. The goal is to accelerate the development of new SDG-aligned features or enable expansion into new development markets, maximizing Ethereum's impact on global sustainable development.

Matching Pool Aim:  ~$182.5K post fees

Round Mechanism:\
Funding will be allocated using a hybrid approach:

-   Conviction Voting (75%): Expert-driven allocation to ensure solutions with strong impact potential are prioritized.

-   Impact Retro (25%): Distributed based on verifiable impact at the 4-month marks, leveraging Karma to reward measurable, high-leverage outcomes.

This structure ensures a community-powered kickstart, while reserving additional flows for solutions demonstrating tangible impact.

Round Operators: LuukDAO (CeloPG) with support from Erik Brinde (Avantgarde Finance)

#### Core Criteria

Projects considered for the Solution Development Grants Program will be evaluated based on the following core criteria, designed to optimize for real-world impact, scalability, and ecosystem legitimacy:

-   SDG Alignment:

-   Projects must directly contribute to one or more Sustainable Development Goals.

-   Features should have clear, measurable pathways to social or environmental impact.

-   Scalability:

-   Solutions should demonstrate potential to expand into new geographies, demographics, or sectors.

-   Emphasis on enabling widespread adoption and replicability.

-   Innovation & Feature Expansion:

-   Development of new functionality or integrations that meaningfully enhance the solution's contribution to SDGs.

-   Leveraging Ethereum's infrastructure to unlock previously unattainable efficiencies or transparency.

-   Sustainability & Adoption Pathways:

-   Clear strategies for long-term maintenance, growth, and adoption, including community engagement, funding sustainability, and open-source contributions.

-   Preference for solutions with proven traction or pilot success.

-   Open-Source, Onchain Orientation:

-   Projects must be open-source and leverage onchain infrastructure, ensuring transparency, auditability, and accessibility.

By applying these criteria, the program aims to scale Ethereum's real-world impact, strengthen the ecosystem, and validate blockchain as essential infrastructure for sustainable development.
